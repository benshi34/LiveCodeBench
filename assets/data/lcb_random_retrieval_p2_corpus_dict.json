Since the sum of bitwise AND decreases monotonically as $l$ decreases, and the value of $nums[i]$ does not exceed $10^9$, the interval $[0, r]$ can have at most $30$ different values. Therefore, we can use a set to maintain all the values of $\\textit{nums}[l] \\land \\textit{nums}[l + 1] \\land \\cdots \\land \\textit{nums}[r]$ and the number of times these values occur.\nWhen we traverse from $r$ to $r+1$, the values with $r+1$ as the right endpoint are the values obtained by performing the bitwise AND operation of each value in the set with $nums[r + 1]$, plus $\\textit{nums}[r + 1]$ itself.\nTherefore, we only need to enumerate each value in the set and perform the bitwise AND operation with $\\textit{nums[r]}$ to get all the values and their occurrences with $r$ as the right endpoint. Then, we need to add the occurrence count of $\\textit{nums[r]}$. At this point, we add the occurrence count of value $k$ to the answer.

On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.\nYou decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.\nGiven two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: You can eat 7 apples:\n- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.\n- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.\n- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Greedy + Priority Queue\nWe can greedily choose the apple that is most likely to rot among the unrotten apples, so that we can eat as many apples as possible.\nTherefore, we can use a priority queue (min heap) to store the rotting time of the apples and the corresponding number of apples. Each time we take out the apple with the smallest rotting time from the priority queue, then reduce its quantity by one. If the quantity of the apple is not zero after reduction, we put it back into the priority queue. If the apple has rotted, we pop it out from the priority queue.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the array apples or days. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given an array nums\u200b\u200b\u200b and an integer k\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.

Therefore, for any $i$, we have:\n$$\nnums[i] \\oplus nums[i+1] \\oplus ... \\oplus nums[i+k-1] = 0\n$$\nand\n$$\nnums[i+1] \\oplus nums[i+2] \\oplus ... \\oplus nums[i+k] = 0\n$$\nCombining the two equations and the properties of XOR operation, we can get $nums[i] \\oplus nums[i+k] = 0$, which means $nums[i]=nums[i+k]$. We find that the elements in the modified array nums are cyclic with a period of $k$. The numbers congruent modulo $k$ can only take a fixed value, and the XOR result of the first $k$ numbers must be $0$.\nFirst, we count each group $i$, the number of elements in each group is $size[i]$, and the number of elements with value $v$ in each group is $cnt[i][v]$.\nNext, we can use dynamic programming to solve it. Let $f[i][j]$ represent the minimum number of modifications with the XOR sum of the first $i+1$ groups being $j$. Since the value of each group is only related to the value of the previous group, we can use a rolling array to optimize the space complexity.\nRedefine $f[j]$ to represent the minimum number of modifications with the XOR sum being $j$ when processing to the current group.\nWhen transitioning states, there are two choices: one is to modify all the numbers in the current group to the same value, then we can choose the one with the smallest previous cost, plus the number of elements $size[i]$ in this group, the cost is $\\min{f[0..n]} + size[i]$; the second is to modify all the numbers in the current group to some value $j$ of the current group, enumerate $j$ and the element $v$ of the current group, then the previous cost is $f[j \\oplus v]$, the cost is $f[j \\oplus v] + size[i] - cnt[i][v]$. Take the minimum value.\nThe final answer is $f[0]$.\nThe time complexity is $O(2^{C}\\times k + n)$.

Formally, it is the number of indices i for 0 <= i <= n-1 where source[i] != target[i] (0-indexed).\nReturn the minimum Hamming distance of source and target after performing any amount of swap operations on array source.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [2,1,4,5], allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: source can be transformed the following way:\n- Swap indices 0 and 1: source = [2,1,3,4]\n- Swap indices 2 and 3: source = [2,1,4,3]\nThe Hamming distance of source and target is 1 as they differ in 1 position: index 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [1,3,2,4], allowedSwaps = []\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are no allowed swaps.\nThe Hamming distance of source and target is 2 as they differ in 2 positions: index 1 and index 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: source = [5,1,2,4,3], target = [1,5,4,2,3], allowedSwaps = [[0,4],[4,2],[1,3],[1,4]]\nOutput: 0\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == source.length == target.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= source[i], target[i] <= 105\n0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 105\nallowedSwaps[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1\nai != bi Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Union-Find + Hash Table\nWe can consider each index as a node, and the element corresponding to each index as the value of the node. Then each element [a_i, b_i] in the given allowedSwaps represents an edge between index a_i and b_i. Therefore, we can use a union-find set to maintain these connected components.\nAfter obtaining each connected component, we use a two-dimensional hash table $cnt$ to count the number of occurrences of each element in each connected component. Finally, for each element in the array target, if its occurrence count in the corresponding connected component is greater than 0, we decrease its count by 1, otherwise, we increase the answer by 1.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log n)$ or $O(n \\times \\alpha(n))$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the array, and $\\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given a floating-point number hour, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.\nEach train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.\n\nFor example, if the 1st train ride takes 1.5 hours, you must wait for an additional 0.5 hours before you can depart on the 2nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.\n\nReturn the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.\nTests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 107 and hour will have at most two digits after the decimal point.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: At speed 1:\n- The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.\n- You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: At speed 3:\n- The first train ride takes 1/3 = 0.33333 hours.\n- Since we are not at an integer hour, we wait until the 1 hour mark to depart. The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.\n- You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == dist.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= dist[i] <= 105\n1 <= hour <= 109\nThere will be at most two digits after the decimal point in hour. Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Binary Search\nWe notice that if a speed value $v$ allows us to arrive within the stipulated time, then for any $v' > v$, we can also definitely arrive within the stipulated time. This exhibits monotonicity, hence we can use binary search to find the smallest speed value that meets the condition.\nBefore conducting the binary search, we need to first determine if it is possible to arrive within the stipulated time. If the number of trains is greater than the ceiling of the stipulated time, then it is definitely impossible to arrive within the stipulated time, and we should directly return $-1$.\nNext, we define the left and right boundaries for the binary search as $l = 1$, $r = 10^7 + 1$, and then we take the middle value $\\textit{mid} = \\frac{l + r}{2}$ each time to check if it meets the condition. If it does, we move the right boundary to $\\textit{mid}$; otherwise, we move the left boundary to $\\textit{mid} + 1$.\nThe problem is transformed into determining whether a speed value $v$ can allow us to arrive within the stipulated time. We can traverse each train trip, calculate the running time of each trip $t = \\frac{d}{v}$, if it is the last trip, we directly add $t$; otherwise, we round up and add $t$. Finally, we check if the total time is less than or equal to the stipulated time, if so, it means the condition is met.\nAfter the binary search ends, if the left boundary exceeds $10^7$, it means we cannot arrive within the stipulated time, and we return $-1$; otherwise, we return the left boundary.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log M)$, where $n$ and $M$ are the number of train trips and the upper bound of the speed, respectively.

In each step of binary search, we find the middle number $mid$. If the number of ugly numbers less than or equal to $mid$ is greater than or equal to $n$, it means that the smallest positive integer $x$ falls in the interval $[l,mid]$, otherwise it falls in the interval $[mid+1,r]$. During the binary search process, we need to continuously update the number of ugly numbers less than or equal to $mid$ until we find the smallest positive integer $x$.\nThe time complexity is $O(\\log m)$, where $m = 2 \\times 10^9$.

If it is a leap year, return true, otherwise return false.\nNext, we define another function daysInMonth(year, month) to calculate the total number of days in the given year year and month month. We can use an array days to store the number of days in each month, where days[1] represents the number of days in February. If it is a leap year, it is $29$ days, otherwise it is $28$ days.\nThen, we define another function calcDays(date) to calculate the number of days from the given date date to 1971-01-01.

Then we can use a loop to calculate the total number of days from 1971 to year, then calculate the total number of days from January to month, and finally add day days.\nFinally, we only need to return the absolute value of calcDays(date1) - calcDays(date2).\nThe time complexity is $O(y + m)$, where $y$ represents the number of years from the given date to 1971-01-01, and $m$ represents the number of months of the given date.

Then we enumerate all positions $j > i$. If $lcp[i][j] > 0$, then position $j$ should also be filled with the character 'a'. Then we add one to the ASCII code of the character 'a' and continue to fill the remaining unfilled positions.\nAfter filling, if there are unfilled positions in the string, it means that the corresponding string cannot be constructed, so we return an empty string.\nNext, we can enumerate each position $i$ and $j$ in the string from large to small, and then judge whether $s[i]$ and $s[j]$ are equal:\n\nIf $s[i] = s[j]$, at this time we need to judge whether $i$ and $j$ are the last positions of the string. If so, then $lcp[i][j]$ should be equal to $1$, otherwise $lcp[i][j]$ should be equal to $0$. If the above conditions are not met, it means that the corresponding string cannot be constructed, so we return an empty string. If $i$ and $j$ are not the last positions of the string, then $lcp[i][j]$ should be equal to $lcp[i + 1][j + 1] + 1$, otherwise it means that the corresponding string cannot be constructed, so we return an empty string.\nOtherwise, if $lcp[i][j] > 0$, it means that the corresponding string cannot be constructed, so we return an empty string.\n\nIf every position in the string meets the above conditions, then we can construct the corresponding string and return it.\nThe time complexity is $O(n^2)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

If there is a ring, the fast and slow pointers will definitely meet, and the meeting node must be in the ring.\nIf there is no ring, the fast pointer will reach the tail of the linked list first, and return null directly.\nIf there is a ring, we then define an answer pointer $ans$ to point to the head of the linked list, and then let $ans$ and the slow pointer move forward together, moving one step at a time, until $ans$ and the slow pointer meet, and the meeting node is the ring entrance node.\nWhy can this find the entrance node of the ring?\nLet's assume that the distance from the head node of the linked list to the entrance of the ring is $x$, the distance from the entrance of the ring to the meeting node is $y$, and the distance from the meeting node to the entrance of the ring is $z$. Then the distance traveled by the slow pointer is $x + y$, and the distance traveled by the fast pointer is $x + y + k \\times (y + z)$, where $k$ is the number of times the fast pointer goes around the ring.\n\nBecause the speed of the fast pointer is twice that of the slow pointer, it is $2 \\times (x + y) = x + y + k \\times (y + z)$, which can be deduced that $x + y = k \\times (y + z)$, that is $x = (k - 1) \\times (y + z) + z$.\nThat is to say, if we define an answer pointer $ans$ to point to the head of the linked list, and the $ans$ and the slow pointer move forward together, they will definitely meet at the ring entrance.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Initially, all are set to $-1$.\nTraverse the array $\\textit{nums}$, set the complement of each element to $0$, and add it to the queue $\\textit{q}$.\nStarting from $k = 1$, continuously traverse the queue $\\textit{q}$. Each time, take out the elements in the queue, perform $m$ complement operations on them, add the complemented elements to the queue $\\textit{t}$, and set the minimum Hamming distance to the original element to $k$.\nRepeat step 3 until the queue is empty.\n\nFinally, we traverse the array $\\textit{nums}$, take the complement of each element as the index, and take out the corresponding minimum Hamming distance from the $\\textit{dist}$ array. Then, $m$ minus this value is the maximum Hamming distance we are looking for.\nThe time complexity is $O(2^m)$, and the space complexity is $O(2^m)$, where $m$ is the integer given in the problem. \n\n", "problem_ids": ["find-the-sum-of-subsequence-powers", "maximum-hamming-distances"]}, "2849": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem:\n\nGiven two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"rabbbit\", t = \"rabbit\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nAs shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate \"rabbit\" from s.\nrabbbit\nrabbbit\nrabbbit\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"babgbag\", t = \"bag\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nAs shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate \"bag\" from s.\nbabgbag\nbabgbag\nbabgbag\nbabgbag\nbabgbag\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000\ns and t consist of English letters.

Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices multiple times and in any order.\nThe Hamming distance of two arrays of the same length, source and target, is the number of positions where the elements are different.

Then each element [a_i, b_i] in the given allowedSwaps represents an edge between index a_i and b_i. Therefore, we can use a union-find set to maintain these connected components.\nAfter obtaining each connected component, we use a two-dimensional hash table $cnt$ to count the number of occurrences of each element in each connected component. Finally, for each element in the array target, if its occurrence count in the corresponding connected component is greater than 0, we decrease its count by 1, otherwise, we increase the answer by 1.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log n)$ or $O(n \\times \\alpha(n))$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

Here, $i$ and $s$ are both non-negative integers, the current search path is $t$, and the answer is $ans$.\nIn the function $dfs(i, s)$, we first check whether $s$ is $0$. If it is, we add the current search path $t$ to the answer $ans$, and then return. If $s \\lt candidates[i]$, it means that the elements of the current index and the following indices are all greater than the remaining target value $s$, and the path is invalid, so we return directly. Otherwise, we start the search from index $i$, and the search index range is $j \\in [i, n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $candidates$.

The logic of the function $dfs(head, root)$ is as follows:\n\nIf the linked list $head$ is empty, it means that the linked list has been traversed, return true;\nIf the binary tree $root$ is empty, it means that the binary tree has been traversed, but the linked list has not been traversed yet, return false;\nIf the value of the binary tree $root$ is not equal to the value of the linked list $head$, return false;\nOtherwise, return $dfs(head.next, root.left)$ or $dfs(head.next, root.right)$.\n\nIn the main function, we call $dfs(head, root)$ for each node of the binary tree.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Hash Table + Priority Queue (Max Heap)\nAccording to the problem description, we need to design a data structure that supports popping out the element with the highest frequency. If multiple elements have the same frequency, the element closest to the top of the stack should be popped out.\nWe can use a hash table $cnt$ to record the frequency of each element, and a priority queue (max heap) $q$ to maintain the frequency of elements and their corresponding timestamps.\nWhen performing a push operation, we first increment the current timestamp, i.e., $ts \\gets ts + 1$; then we increment the frequency of the element $val$, i.e., $cnt[val] \\gets cnt[val] + 1$, and finally, we add the triplet $(cnt[val], ts, val)$ to the priority queue $q$. The time complexity of the push operation is $O(\\log n)$.\nWhen performing a pop operation, we directly pop an element from the priority queue $q$. Since the elements in the priority queue $q$ are sorted in descending order of frequency, the popped element is definitely the one with the highest frequency. If multiple elements have the same frequency, the element closest to the top of the stack is popped out, i.e., the element with the largest timestamp is popped out. After popping, we decrement the frequency of the popped element, i.e., $cnt[val] \\gets cnt[val] - 1$. The time complexity of the pop operation is $O(\\log n)$. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given a string s, which is known to be a concatenation of anagrams of some string t.\nReturn the minimum possible length of the string t.\nAn anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of a string.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Enumeration\nBased on the problem description, the length of string $\\textit{t}$ must be a factor of the length of string $\\textit{s}$. We can enumerate the length $k$ of string $\\textit{t}$ from small to large, and then check if it meets the requirements of the problem. If it does, we return. Thus, the problem is transformed into how to check whether the length $k$ of string $\\textit{t}$ meets the requirements.\nFirst, we count the occurrence of each character in string $\\textit{s}$ and record it in an array or hash table $\\textit{cnt}$.\nNext, we define a function $\\textit{check}(k)$ to check whether the length $k$ of string $\\textit{t}$ meets the requirements. We can traverse string $\\textit{s}$, taking a substring of length $k$ each time, and then count the occurrence of each character. If the occurrence of each character multiplied by $\\frac{n}{k}$ does not equal the value in $\\textit{cnt}$, then return $\\textit{false}$. If all checks pass by the end of the traversal, return $\\textit{true}$.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times A)$, where $n$ is the length of string $\\textit{s}$, and $A$ is the number of factors of $n$. The space complexity is $O(|\\Sigma|)$, where $\\Sigma$ is the character set, which in this case is the set of lowercase letters. \n\n", "problem_ids": ["maximum-frequency-stack", "minimum-length-of-anagram-concatenation"]}, "2891": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given two integers,\u00a0n and k.\nAn array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.\nReturn the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, k = 4\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.\nIt can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 2, k = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.\nIt can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n, k <= 50 Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Greedy + Simulation\nWe start from the positive integer $i=1$, and judge whether $i$ can be added to the array in turn.

In the enumeration process, we need to skip duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets.\nThe specific judgment logic is as follows:\nIf $i \\gt 0$ and $nums[i] = nums[i - 1]$, it means that the element currently enumerated is the same as the previous element, we can skip it directly, because it will not produce new results.\nIf $nums[i] \\gt 0$, it means that the element currently enumerated is greater than $0$, so the sum of three numbers must not be equal to $0$, and the enumeration ends.\nOtherwise, we let the left pointer $j = i + 1$, and the right pointer $k = n - 1$.

We can represent each string with a binary number $mask[i]$, where each bit of this binary number indicates whether the string contains a certain letter. If two strings do not have common letters, then the bitwise AND result of the two binary numbers corresponding to these strings is $0$, that is, $mask[i] \\& mask[j] = 0$.\nWe traverse each string.

We traverse the string from left to right. Each time we traverse to position $i$, we increase the occurrence of $s[i]$, and then check whether $s[i]$ appears at least twice. If so, we need to decrease the occurrence of $s[j]$ and move $j$ one step to the right, until the occurrence of $s[i]$ does not exceed once. In this way, we get the length of the longest special substring ending with $s[i]$, which is $i - j + 1$, so the number of special substrings ending with $s[i]$ is $i - j + 1$. Finally, we add up the number of special substrings ending at each position to get the answer.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(C)$.

For example if n = 3 and two employees are leaving building 0, one is leaving building 1, and one is leaving building 2, there should be two employees moving to building 0, one employee moving to building 1, and one employee moving to building 2.\nReturn the maximum number of achievable requests.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]\nOutput: 5\nExplantion: Let's see the requests:\nFrom building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.\nFrom building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.\nFrom building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.\nFrom building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.\nFrom building 4 we don't have any requests.\nWe can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.\nWe can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]\nOutput: 3\nExplantion: Let's see the requests:\nFrom building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.\nFrom building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.\nFrom building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.\nWe can achieve all the requests. \nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]\nOutput: 4\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 20\n1 <= requests.length <= 16\nrequests[i].length == 2\n0 <= fromi, toi < n Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Binary Enumeration\nWe note that the length of the room change request list does not exceed $16$. Therefore, we can use the method of binary enumeration to enumerate all room change request lists. Specifically, we can use a binary number of length $16$ to represent a room change request list, where the $i$-th bit being $1$ means the $i$-th room change request is selected, and $0$ means the $i$-th room change request is not selected.\nWe enumerate all binary numbers in the range of $[1, 2^{m})$, for each binary number $mask$, we first calculate how many $1$s are in its binary representation, denoted as $cnt$. If $cnt$ is larger than the current answer $ans$, then we judge whether $mask$ is a feasible room change request list. If it is, then we update the answer $ans$ with $cnt$. To judge whether $mask$ is a feasible room change request list, we only need to check whether the net inflow of each room is $0$.\nThe time complexity is $O(2^m \\times (m + n))$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of the room change request list and the number of rooms, respectively. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and numbered (left to right) from 0, each of the stacks has the same maximum capacity.\nImplement the DinnerPlates class:\n\nDinnerPlates(int capacity) Initializes the object with the maximum capacity of the stacks capacity.\nvoid push(int val) Pushes the given integer val into the leftmost stack with a size less than capacity.\nint pop() Returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack, and returns -1 if all the stacks are empty.\nint popAtStack(int index) Returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index index and removes it from that stack or returns -1 if the stack with that given index is empty.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"DinnerPlates\", \"push\", \"push\", \"push\", \"push\", \"push\", \"popAtStack\", \"push\", \"push\", \"popAtStack\", \"popAtStack\", \"pop\", \"pop\", \"pop\", \"pop\", \"pop\"]\n[[2], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [0], [20], [21], [0], [2], [], [], [], [], []]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, null, null, 20, 21, 5, 4, 3, 1, -1]\n\nExplanation: \nDinnerPlates D = DinnerPlates(2);  // Initialize with capacity = 2\nD.push(1);\nD.push(2);\nD.push(3);\nD.push(4);\nD.push(5);         // The stacks are now:  2  4\n                                           1  3  5\n                                           \ufe48 \ufe48 \ufe48\nD.popAtStack(0);   // Returns 2.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Stack Array + Ordered Set\nWe define the following data structures or variables:\n\ncapacity: The capacity of each stack;\nstacks: Stack array, used to store all stacks, each with a maximum capacity of capacity;\nnot_full: Ordered set, used to store the indices of all non-full stacks in the stack array.\n\nFor the push(val) operation:\n\nWe first check if not_full is empty. If it is, it means there are no non-full stacks, so we need to create a new stack and push val into it. At this point, we check if the capacity capacity is greater than $1$. If it is, we add the index of this stack to not_full.\nIf not_full is not empty, it means there are non-full stacks. We take out the smallest index index from not_full, and push val into stacks[index]. At this point, if the capacity of stacks[index] equals capacity, we remove index from not_full.\n\nFor the popAtStack(index) operation:\n\nWe first check if index is within the index range of stacks. If it is not, we directly return $-1$. If stacks[index] is empty, we also directly return $-1$.\nIf stacks[index] is not empty, we pop the top element val from stacks[index]. If index equals the length of stacks minus $1$, it means stacks[index] is the last stack. If it is empty, we loop to remove the index of the last stack from not_full, and remove the last stack from the stack array stacks, until the last stack is not empty, or the stack array stacks is empty. Otherwise, if stacks[index] is not the last stack, we add index to not_full.\nFinally, return val.\n\nFor the pop() operation:\n\nWe directly call popAtStack(stacks.length - 1).\n\nThe time complexity is $(n \\times \\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

The search space for this problem is not large, so we can directly use the naive BFS. The solution below also provides the code for bidirectional BFS for reference.\nBidirectional BFS is a common optimization method for BFS. The main implementation ideas are as follows:\n\nCreate two queues, q1 and q2, for \"start -> end\" and \"end -> start\" search directions, respectively.\nCreate two hash maps, m1 and m2, to record the visited nodes and their corresponding expansion times (steps).\nDuring each search, prioritize the queue with fewer elements for search expansion. If a node visited from the other direction is found during the expansion, it means the shortest path has been found.\nIf one of the queues is empty, it means that the search in the current direction cannot continue, indicating that the start and end points are not connected, and there is no need to continue the search. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nGiven a binary string s \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bwithout leading zeros, return true\u200b\u200b\u200b if s contains at most one contiguous segment of ones.

The count is related to the number of digits and the digits in each binary position. We can solve this problem using the digit DP approach. In digit DP, the size of the number has little impact on the complexity.\nFor the interval $[l,..r]$ problem, we generally convert it to the problem of $[0,..r]$ and then subtract the problem of $[0,..l - 1]$, i.e.:\n$$\nans = \\sum_{i=0}^{r} ans_i -  \\sum_{i=0}^{l-1} ans_i\n$$\nHowever, for this problem, we only need to find the value for the interval $[0,..r]$.\nHere we use memoization to implement digit DP. The basic steps are as follows:\n\nConvert the number $n$ to a binary string $s$;\nAccording to the problem information, design the function $\\textit{dfs}()$. For this problem, we define $\\textit{dfs}(\\textit{pos}, \\textit{pre}, \\textit{limit})$, and the answer is $\\textit{dfs}(\\textit{0}, 0, \\textit{true})$.\n\nWhere:\n\npos represents the digit position, starting from the highest digit of the number, i.e., the first character of the binary string;\npre represents the digit at the current binary position.

If there is no restriction, then $[0,1]$ can be chosen; otherwise, only $[0,..s[\\textit{pos}]]$ can be chosen.\n\nFor the implementation details of the function, refer to the code below.\nTime complexity is $O(\\log n)$, and space complexity is $O(\\log n)$.

This shows monotonicity, therefore, we can use binary search to find the maximum $x$ that satisfies the condition.\nWe define the left boundary of the binary search as $l=0$, and the right boundary as $r=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} sweetness[i]$. Each time, we take the middle value $mid$ of $l$ and $r$, and then determine whether we can eat a piece of chocolate with sweetness $mid$. If we can, then we try to eat a piece of chocolate with greater sweetness, i.e., let $l=mid$; otherwise, we try to eat a piece of chocolate with smaller sweetness, i.e., let $r=mid-1$. After the binary search ends, we return $l$.\nThe key to the problem is how to determine whether we can eat a piece of chocolate with sweetness $x$. We can use a greedy approach, traverse the array from left to right, accumulate the current sweetness each time, when the accumulated sweetness is greater than or equal to $x$, the chocolate count $cnt$ is increased by $1$, and the accumulated sweetness is reset to zero.

At this time, if $nums[mid] \\lt target \\le nums[r]$, it means that $target$ is in $[mid+1,r]$, otherwise $target$ is in $[l,mid]$.\nIf $nums[mid] = nums[r]$, it means that the elements $nums[mid]$ and $nums[r]$ are equal. At this time, we cannot determine which interval $target$ is in, so we can only decrease $r$ by $1$.\n\nAfter the binary search ends, if $nums[l] = target$, it means that the target value $target$ exists in the array, otherwise it means it does not exist.\nThe time complexity is approximately $O(\\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of operations for each column to have the same number, and the numbers in adjacent columns are different. Therefore, we only need to consider the case of modifying the number to 0 to 9.\nWe define the state $f[i][j]$ to represent the minimum number of operations for the numbers in the first $[0,..i]$ columns, and the number in the $i$-th column is $j$. Then we can get the state transition equation:\n$$\nf[i][j] = \\min_{k \\neq j} (f[i-1][k] + m - \\textit{cnt}[j])\n$$\nWhere $\\textit{cnt}[j]$ represents the number of cells in the $i$-th column that are $j$.\nFinally, we only need to find the minimum value of $f[n-1][j]$.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times (m + C^2))$, and the space complexity is $O(n \\times C)$. Where $m$ and $n$ represent the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively; and $C$ represents the number of types of numbers, here $C = 10$. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nGiven an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.\nFrom each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down.

The answer is $\\max_{i, j} \\textit{dfs}(i, j)$.\nThe execution logic of the function $dfs(i, j)$ is as follows:\n\nIf $(i, j)$ has been visited, directly return $\\textit{f}(i, j)$;\nOtherwise, search $(i, j)$, search the coordinates $(x, y)$ in four directions. If $0 \\le x < m, 0 \\le y < n$ and $matrix[x][y] > matrix[i][j]$, then search $(x, y)$. After the search is over, update $\\textit{f}(i, j)$ to $\\textit{f}(i, j) = \\max(\\textit{f}(i, j), \\textit{f}(x, y) + 1)$.

Therefore, we can group all words by length and last letter, and use a trie to store the information of each group of words.\nThe structure of each node in the trie is as follows:\n\nchildren: An array of length $26$, representing all child nodes of this node.\ncnt: The number of words passing through this node.\n\nFor each word, we insert it into the trie and record the cnt value of each node.\nWhen querying, we start from the root node. For the current letter, if the cnt value of its corresponding child node is $1$, then we have found the unique abbreviation, and we return the length of the current prefix. Otherwise, we continue to traverse downwards. After the traversal, if we have not found a unique abbreviation, then we return the length of the original word. After getting the prefix lengths of all words, we check whether the abbreviation of the word is shorter than the original word.

If we sort the array $nums$ in ascending order, it would be best to turn a continuous segment of numbers into the same number, which can reduce the number of operations and increase the frequency of the mode.\nTherefore, we might as well sort the array $nums$ first.\nNext, we analyze that if a frequency $x$ is feasible, then for any $y \\le x$, the frequency $y$ is also feasible, which shows monotonicity. Therefore, we can use binary search to find the maximum feasible frequency.\nWe binary search the frequency, define the left boundary of the binary search as $l = 0$, and the right boundary as $r = n$, where $n$ is the length of the array. In each binary search process, we take the middle value $mid = \\lfloor \\frac{l + r + 1}{2} \\rfloor$, and then determine whether there exists a continuous subarray of length $mid$ in $nums$, such that all elements in this subarray become the median of this subarray, and the number of operations does not exceed $k$. If it exists, then we update the left boundary $l$ to $mid$, otherwise we update the right boundary $r$ to $mid - 1$.\nTo determine whether such a subarray exists, we can use prefix sum.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Stack Array + Ordered Set\nWe define the following data structures or variables:\n\ncapacity: The capacity of each stack;\nstacks: Stack array, used to store all stacks, each with a maximum capacity of capacity;\nnot_full: Ordered set, used to store the indices of all non-full stacks in the stack array.\n\nFor the push(val) operation:\n\nWe first check if not_full is empty. If it is, it means there are no non-full stacks, so we need to create a new stack and push val into it. At this point, we check if the capacity capacity is greater than $1$. If it is, we add the index of this stack to not_full.\nIf not_full is not empty, it means there are non-full stacks. We take out the smallest index index from not_full, and push val into stacks[index]. At this point, if the capacity of stacks[index] equals capacity, we remove index from not_full.\n\nFor the popAtStack(index) operation:\n\nWe first check if index is within the index range of stacks. If it is not, we directly return $-1$. If stacks[index] is empty, we also directly return $-1$.\nIf stacks[index] is not empty, we pop the top element val from stacks[index]. If index equals the length of stacks minus $1$, it means stacks[index] is the last stack. If it is empty, we loop to remove the index of the last stack from not_full, and remove the last stack from the stack array stacks, until the last stack is not empty, or the stack array stacks is empty. Otherwise, if stacks[index] is not the last stack, we add index to not_full.\nFinally, return val.\n\nFor the pop() operation:\n\nWe directly call popAtStack(stacks.length - 1).\n\nThe time complexity is $(n \\times \\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.\nAt the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:\n\nIf it has not, it will resend the message periodically.

Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.\n-   Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.\n-   Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).\n\nAt second 2,\n\n-   The reply 1A arrives at server 1.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: BFS\nFirst, we construct an undirected graph $g$ based on the 2D array $edges$, where $g[u]$ represents all neighboring nodes of node $u$.\nThen, we can use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest distance $d_i$ from each node $i$ to the main server. The earliest time that node $i$ can receive a reply after sending a message is $2 \\times d_i$. Since each data server $i$ resends a message every $patience[i]$ seconds, the last time that each data server sends a message is $(2 \\times d_i - 1) / patience[i] \\times patience[i]$. Therefore, the latest time that the network becomes idle is $(2 \\times d_i - 1) / patience[i] \\times patience[i] + 2 \\times d_i$, plus 1 second for processing time. We find the latest of these times, which is the earliest time that the computer network becomes idle.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

Therefore, we select the largest element $x$ in the array for the first time, $x+1$ for the second time, $x+2$ for the third time, and so on, until the $k$th time we select $x+k-1$. This way of selection ensures that the element selected each time is the largest in the current array, so the final score is also the largest.

Therefore, a beautiful string does not contain any palindrome substring of length $2$ or longer, which means that each character in the string is different from its previous two adjacent characters.\nWe can greedily search backwards from the last index of the string, find an index $i$ such that the character at index $i$ can be replaced by a slightly larger character, while ensuring that it is different from its two previous adjacent characters.\n\nIf such an index $i$ is found, then we replace $s[i]$ with $c$, and replace the characters from $s[i+1]$ to $s[n-1]$ with the characters in the first $k$ characters of the alphabet in the order of the minimum dictionary that are not the same as the previous two adjacent characters.

Therefore, if we calculate the difference between the corresponding elements of the two arrays and get another array $nums$, the problem is transformed into finding the number of pairs in $nums$ that satisfy $nums[i] \\leq nums[j] + diff$.\nWe can enumerate $j$ from small to large, find out how many numbers before it satisfy $nums[i] \\leq nums[j] + diff$, and thus calculate the number of pairs. We can use a binary indexed tree to maintain the prefix sum, so we can find out how many numbers before it satisfy $nums[i] \\leq nums[j] + diff$ in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log n)$. \n\n", "problem_ids": ["day-of-the-week", "number-of-pairs-satisfying-inequality"]}, "3172": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem:\n\nGiven an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of good subarrays of nums.\nA subarray arr is good if it there are at least k pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] == arr[j].\nA subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 10\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only good subarray is the array nums itself.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There are 4 different good subarrays:\n- [3,1,4,3,2,2] that has 2 pairs.\n- [3,1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 3 pairs.\n- [1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.\n- [4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i], k <= 109 Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Hash Table + Two Pointers\nIf a subarray contains $k$ pairs of identical elements, then an array that contains this subarray must contain at least $k$ pairs of identical elements.\nWe use a hash table $cnt$ to count the number of occurrences of each element in the window, use $cur$ to count the number of pairs of identical elements in the window, and use $i$ to maintain the left endpoint of the window.\nWe traverse the array $nums$, take the current element $x$ as the right endpoint, then the number of pairs of identical elements in the window will increase by $cnt[x]$, and the occurrence times of $x$ will be increased by one, i.e., $cnt[x] \\leftarrow cnt[x] + 1$. Next, we loop to judge whether the number of pairs of identical elements in the window is greater than or equal to $k$ after removing the left endpoint. If it is greater than or equal to $k$, then we decrease the occurrence times of the left endpoint element by one, i.e., $cnt[nums[i]] \\leftarrow cnt[nums[i]] - 1$, and decrease the number of pairs of identical elements in the window by $cnt[nums[i]]$, i.e., $cur \\leftarrow cur - cnt[nums[i]]$, and move the left endpoint to the right, i.e., $i \\leftarrow i + 1$. At this time, all elements to the left of the window left endpoint and the left endpoint itself can be used as the left endpoint of the current right endpoint, so the answer is increased by $i + 1$.\nFinally, we return the answer.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $nums$. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.\nYou are initially standing at index 0.

The value of $f[i]$ can be transferred from $f[j]$, where $j$ satisfies $i - k \\leq j \\leq i - 1$. Therefore, we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.\nThe state transition equation is:\n$$\nf[i] = \\max_{j \\in [i - k, i - 1]} f[j] + nums[i]\n$$\nWe can use a monotonic queue to optimize the state transition equation. Specifically, we maintain a monotonically decreasing queue, which stores the index $j$, and the $f[j]$ values corresponding to the indices in the queue are monotonically decreasing. When performing state transition, we only need to take out the index $j$ at the front of the queue to get the maximum value of $f[j]$, and then update the value of $f[i]$ to $f[j] + nums[i]$.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

We need to ensure that $nums[j]$ has not been used and is different from the number enumerated before, so as to ensure that the current permutation is not repeated.

Next, we use a priority queue (min heap) to maintain the currently executable tasks. The elements in the queue are (processingTime, index), which represent the execution time and the index of the task. We also use a variable $t$ to represent the current time, initially set to $0$.\nNext, we simulate the execution process of the tasks.\nIf the current queue is empty, it means there are no executable tasks at the moment. We update $t$ to the larger value between the enqueueTime of the next task and the current time $t$. Then, we add all tasks with enqueueTime less than or equal to $t$ to the queue.\nThen, we take out a task from the queue, add its index to the answer array, and update $t$ to the sum of the current time $t$ and the execution time of the current task.\nWe repeat the above process until the queue is empty and all tasks have been added to the queue.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks. \n\n", "problem_ids": ["unique-number-of-occurrences", "single-threaded-cpu"]}, "3188": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given an even integer n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.

As long as a number (except for numbers $0$ and $n-1$) returns to its original position, the entire sequence will be consistent with the previous one.\nTherefore, we choose the number $1$, whose initial index is also $1$.

We put the current $g$ into the answer array and end the recursion.\nOtherwise, we enumerate each column $j$ of the current row. If there is no queen at position $(i, j)$, that is, $col[j]$, $dg[i + j]$, and $udg[n - i + j]$ are all $0$, then we can place a queen, that is, change $g[i][j]$ to 'Q', and set $col[j]$, $dg[i + j]$, and $udg[n - i + j]$ to $1$. Then we continue to search the next row, that is, call $dfs(i + 1)$.

For $arr[i]$, we find the first position $left[i]$ to its left that is less than $arr[i]$, and the first position $right[i]$ to its right that is less than or equal to $arr[i]$. The number of subarrays for which $arr[i]$ is the minimum is $(i - left[i]) \\times (right[i] - i)$.\nNote, why do we find the first position $right[i]$ to the right that is less than or equal to $arr[i]$, rather than less than $arr[i]$? This is because if we find the first position $right[i]$ to the right that is less than $arr[i]$, it will lead to duplicate calculations.\nLet's take an example to illustrate. For the following array:\nThe element at index $3$ is $2$, the first element to its left that is less than $2$ is at index $0$. If we find the first element to its right that is less than $2$, we get index $7$. That is, the subarray interval is $(0, 7)$. Note that this is an open interval.\n0 4 3 2 5 3 2 1\n*     ^       *\nIn the same way, we can find the subarray interval for the element at index $6$, and find that its subarray interval is also $(0, 7)$. That is, the subarray intervals for the elements at index $3$ and index $6$ are the same. This leads to duplicate calculations.\n0 4 3 2 5 3 2 1\n*           ^ *\nIf we find the first element to its right that is less than or equal to its value, there will be no duplication, because the subarray interval for the element at index $3$ becomes $(0, 6)$, and the subarray interval for the element at index $6$ is $(0, 7)$, which are not the same.\nBack to this problem, we just need to traverse the array, for each element $arr[i]$, use a monotonic stack to find the first position $left[i]$ to its left that is less than $arr[i]$, and the first position $right[i]$ to its right that is less than or equal to $arr[i]$. The number of subarrays for which $arr[i]$ is the minimum is $(i - left[i]) \\times (right[i] - i)$, then multiply by $arr[i]$, and finally sum these up.\nBe aware of data overflow and modulo operations.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $arr$. \n\n", "problem_ids": ["watering-plants", "sum-of-subarray-minimums"]}, "3193": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given an integer array nums of length n, and a positive integer k.\nThe power of a subsequence is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.\nReturn the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums which have length equal to k.\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nThere are 4 subsequences in nums which have length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], and [2,3,4].

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: State Compression + Hash Table + Subset Enumeration\nAccording to the problem description, for each puzzle $p$ in the puzzle array $puzzles$, we need to count how many words $w$ contain the first letter of the puzzle $p$, and every letter in $w$ can be found in $p$.\nSince each repeated letter in a word only needs to be counted once, we can use the method of binary state compression to convert each word $w$ into a binary number $mask$, where the $i$th bit of $mask$ is $1$ if and only if the letter $i$ appears in the word $w$. We use a hash table $cnt$ to count the number of times each compressed state of all words appears.\nNext, we traverse the puzzle array $puzzles$. For each puzzle $p$, we note that its length is fixed at $7$, so we only need to enumerate the subsets of $p$. If the subset contains the first letter of $p$, then we look up its corresponding value in the hash table and add it to the current puzzle's answer.\nAfter the traversal, we can get the number of puzzle solutions corresponding to each puzzle in the puzzle array $puzzles$, and return it.\nThe time complexity is $O(m \\times |w| + n \\times 2^{|p|})$, and the space complexity is $O(m)$. Here, $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of the arrays $words$ and $puzzles$ respectively, and $|w|$ and $|p|$ are the maximum length of the words in the array $words$ and the length of the puzzles in the array $puzzles$, respectively. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nGiven a string s, return whether s is a valid number.\n\nFor example, all the following are valid numbers: \"2\", \"0089\", \"-0.1\", \"+3.14\", \"4.\", \"-.9\", \"2e10\", \"-90E3\", \"3e+7\", \"+6e-1\", \"53.5e93\", \"-123.456e789\", while the following are not valid numbers: \"abc\", \"1a\", \"1e\", \"e3\", \"99e2.5\", \"--6\", \"-+3\", \"95a54e53\".\nFormally, a\u00a0valid number is defined using one of the following definitions:\n\nAn integer number followed by an optional exponent.\nA decimal number followed by an optional exponent.\n\nAn integer number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by digits.\nA decimal number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by one of the following definitions:\n\nDigits followed by a dot '.'.\nDigits followed by a dot '.' followed by digits.\nA dot '.' followed by digits.\n\nAn exponent is defined with an exponent notation 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer number.\nThe digits are defined as one or more digits.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"0\"\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"e\"\nOutput: false\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \".\"\nOutput: false\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 20\ns consists of only English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), plus '+', minus '-', or dot '.'. Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Case Discussion\nFirst, we check if the string starts with a positive or negative sign. If it does, we move the pointer $i$ one step forward. If the pointer $i$ has reached the end of the string at this point, it means the string only contains a positive or negative sign, so we return false.\nIf the character pointed to by the current pointer $i$ is a decimal point, and there is no number after the decimal point, or if there is an e or E after the decimal point, we return false.\nNext, we use two variables $dot$ and $e$ to record the number of decimal points and e or E respectively.\nWe use pointer $j$ to point to the current character:\n\nIf the current character is a decimal point, and a decimal point or e or E has appeared before, return false. Otherwise, we increment $dot$ by one;\nIf the current character is e or E, and e or E has appeared before, or if the current character is at the beginning or end of the string, return false.

Initially, $f[0] = g[0] = 1$ because when there is only one element, the length of the wiggle sequence is $1$. Initialize the answer as $1$.\nFor $f[i]$, where $i \\geq 1$, we enumerate $j$ in the range $[0, i)$, if $nums[j] < nums[i]$, it means that $i$ can be appended after $j$ to form an upward wiggle sequence, then $f[i] = \\max(f[i], g[j] + 1)$; if $nums[j] > nums[i]$, it means that $i$ can be appended after $j$ to form a downward wiggle sequence, then $g[i] = \\max(g[i], f[j] + 1)$. Then we update the answer to $\\max(f[i], g[i])$.\nFinally, we return the answer.\nThe time complexity is $O(n^2)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

At this point, we need to check whether it meets the requirements of the four segments of the IP address. If it does, add the current $IP$ to the answer.\nIf $i$ is less than the length of string $s$, it means that we still need to splice a segment of the IP address. At this point, we need to determine the value of this segment of the IP address. If the value is greater than $255$, or the current position $i$ is $0$ and the value of several positions after $i$ is greater than $0$, it means that it does not meet the requirements, so we return directly. Otherwise, add it to the IP address list, and continue to search for the next segment of the IP address.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times 3^4)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

The minimum value of all $f(v)$ is the answer.\nThe calculation method of function $f(v)$ is as follows:\nTraverse each element $x$ in the array $nums$. If $x < v$, it means that we need to delete all characters with a frequency of $x$, and the number of deletions is $x$.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Enumeration\nWe can enumerate all the substrings that end with each character $s[i]$ and calculate their gravitational value sum $t$. Finally, we add up all the $t$ to get the total gravitational value sum.\nWhen we reach $s[i]$, which is added to the end of the substring that ends with $s[i-1]$, we consider the change of the gravitational value sum $t$:\nIf $s[i]$ has not appeared before, then the gravitational value of all substrings that end with $s[i-1]$ will increase by $1$, and there are a total of $i$ such substrings. Therefore, $t$ increases by $i$, plus the gravitational value of $s[i]$ itself, which is $1$. Therefore, $t$ increases by a total of $i+1$.\nIf $s[i]$ has appeared before, let the last appearance position be $j$. Then we add $s[i]$ to the end of the substrings $s[0..i-1]$, $[1..i-1]$, $s[2..i-1]$, $\\cdots$, $s[j..i-1]$. The gravitational value of these substrings will not change because $s[i]$ has already appeared in these substrings. The gravitational value of the substrings $s[j+1..i-1]$, $s[j+2..i-1]$, $\\cdots$, $s[i-1]$ will increase by $1$, and there are a total of $i-j-1$ such substrings. Therefore, $t$ increases by $i-j-1$, plus the gravitational value of $s[i]$ itself, which is $1$. Therefore, $t$ increases by a total of $i-j$.\nTherefore, we can use an array $pos$ to record the last appearance position of each character. Initially, all positions are set to $-1$.\nNext, we traverse the string, and each time we update the gravitational value sum $t$ of the substring that ends with the current character to $t = t + i - pos[c]$, where $c$ is the current character. We add $t$ to the answer. Then we update $pos[c]$ to the current position $i$. We continue to traverse until the end of the string.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(|\\Sigma|)$, where $n$ is the length of the string $s$, and $|\\Sigma|$ is the size of the character set.

Therefore, we can use the binary search method to find the smallest maximum difference that satisfies the condition.\nWe can sort the array nums, then enumerate the maximum difference $x$, and determine whether there are $p$ index pairs, where each index pair corresponds to the maximum value of the difference of the corresponding value. If it exists, we can reduce $x$, otherwise we can increase $x$.\nDetermine whether there are $p$ index pairs, where each index pair corresponds to the maximum value of the difference of the corresponding value, which can be achieved by using the greedy method. We traverse the array nums from left to right, and for the current traversed index $i$, if the difference between the number at the $i+1$ position and the number at the $i$ position is no more than $x$, then we can take the number at the $i$ and $i+1$ positions as an index pair, update the number of index pairs $cnt$, and then increase the value of $i$ by $2$. Otherwise, we will increase the value of $i$ by $1$. When the traversal is over, if the value of $cnt$ is greater than or equal to $p$, then it means that there are $p$ index pairs, where each index pair corresponds to the maximum value of the difference of the corresponding value, otherwise it means that it does not exist.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times (\\log n + \\log m))$, where $n$ is the length of the array nums, and $m$ is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the array nums.

Since $A_1 = A_2$ and $B_1=B_4$, then $B_3=B_1=B_4=B_2$, and $C_1 = C_2$.

Since the length of the string is only $n$, dividing it into more than $n$ segments will inevitably lead to some segments with a length of $0$, which can be deleted. Therefore, we only need to limit the range of $k$ to $[1,.. n]$.\nWe enumerate the number of segments $k$ from small to large. Let the length of $a$ segments in all segments be $sa$, the length of $b$ segments in all segments be $sb$, and the length of all symbols (including angle brackets and slashes) in all segments be $sc$.\nThen the value of $sa$ is ${\\textstyle \\sum_{j=1}^{k}} len(s_j)$, which can be directly obtained through the prefix sum; the value of $sb$ is $len(str(k)) \\times k$; and the value of $sc$ is $3 \\times k$.\nTherefore, the number of characters that can be filled in all segments is $limit\\times k - (sa + sb + sc)$. If this value is greater than or equal to $n$, it means that the string can be divided into $k$ segments, and we can directly construct the answer and return it.\nThe time complexity is $O(n\\times \\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string message.

Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.\n\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n\nIn the beginning, curOrder will be [\"king\"].\nCalling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\"].\nCalling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"].\nCalling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\nCalling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null.

Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: Preorder Traversal of a Multi-branch Tree\nAccording to the problem description, we can find that the order of throne inheritance is actually a preorder traversal of a multi-branch tree. We can use a hash table $g$ to store the children of each person, and a set $dead$ to store the people who have died.\n\nWhen calling birth(parentName, childName), we add childName to the child list of parentName.\nWhen calling death(name), we add name to the dead set.\nWhen calling getInheritanceOrder(), we start a depth-first search from the king. If the current node x is not dead, we add x to the answer list, and then recursively traverse all children of x.\n\nIn terms of time complexity, both birth and death have a time complexity of $O(1)$, and getInheritanceOrder has a time complexity of $O(n)$.

Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.\nAt the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:\n\nIf it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server.\nOtherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.\n\nThe network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.\nReturn the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], patience = [0,2,1]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\nAt (the beginning of) second 0,\n- Data server 1 sends its message (denoted 1A) to the master server.\n- Data server 2 sends its message (denoted 2A) to the master server.\n\nAt second 1,\n\n-   Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.\n-   Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.\n-   Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).\n\nAt second 2,\n\n-   The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1.\n-   Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back.\n-   Server 2 resends the message (denoted 2C).\n    ...\n    At second 4,\n-   The reply 2A arrives at server 2. No more resending will occur from server 2.\n    ...\n    At second 7, reply 2D arrives at server 2.\n\nStarting from the beginning of the second 8, there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.\nThis is the time when the network becomes idle.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]], patience = [0,10,10]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Data servers 1 and 2 receive a reply back at the beginning of second 2.\nFrom the beginning of the second 3, the network becomes idle.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == patience.length\n2 <= n <= 105\npatience[0] == 0\n1 <= patience[i] <= 105 for 1 <= i < n\n1 <= edges.length <= min(105, n * (n - 1) / 2)\nedges[i].length == 2\n0 <= ui, vi < n\nui != vi\nThere are no duplicate edges.\nEach server can directly or indirectly reach another server. Explanation:\n\nSolution 1: BFS\nFirst, we construct an undirected graph $g$ based on the 2D array $edges$, where $g[u]$ represents all neighboring nodes of node $u$.\nThen, we can use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest distance $d_i$ from each node $i$ to the main server. The earliest time that node $i$ can receive a reply after sending a message is $2 \\times d_i$. Since each data server $i$ resends a message every $patience[i]$ seconds, the last time that each data server sends a message is $(2 \\times d_i - 1) / patience[i] \\times patience[i]$. Therefore, the latest time that the network becomes idle is $(2 \\times d_i - 1) / patience[i] \\times patience[i] + 2 \\times d_i$, plus 1 second for processing time. We find the latest of these times, which is the earliest time that the computer network becomes idle.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes. \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given two 0-indexed arrays nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.\nYou can do the following operation any number of times:\n\nIncrease or decrease any element of the array nums by 1.\n\nThe cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].\nReturn the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:\n- Increase the 0th element one time.

We can assume that $a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_n$, i.e., the array nums is sorted in ascending order.\nSuppose we change all elements in the array nums to $x$, then the total cost we need is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left | a_i-x \\right | b_i  &= \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (x-a_i)b_i + \\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} (a_i-x)b_i \\\n&= x\\sum_{i=1}^{k} b_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_ib_i + \\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}a_ib_i - x\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}b_i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of elements in $a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n$ that are less than or equal to $x$.\nWe can use the prefix sum method to calculate $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} b_i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_ib_i$, as well as $\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}a_ib_i$ and $\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}b_i$.\nThen we enumerate $x$, calculate the above four prefix sums, get the total cost mentioned above, and take the minimum value.\nThe time complexity is $O(n\\times \\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array nums. The main time complexity comes from sorting. \n\n", "problem_ids": ["the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle", "minimum-cost-to-make-array-equal"]}, "3236": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem:\n\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

Therefore, we can use binary search to find the maximum average number.\nWhat are the left and right boundaries of binary search? The left boundary $l$ must be the minimum value in the array, and the right boundary $r$ is the maximum value in the array. Next, we binary search the midpoint $mid$, and judge whether there exists a subarray with length greater than or equal to $k$ whose average value is greater than or equal to $mid$. If it exists, then we update the left boundary $l$ to $mid$, otherwise we update the right boundary $r$ to $mid$. When the difference between the left and right boundaries is less than a very small non-negative number, i.e., $r - l < \\epsilon$, we can get the maximum average number, where $\\epsilon$ represents a very small positive number, which can be $10^{-5}$.\nThe key to the problem is how to judge whether the average value of a subarray with length greater than or equal to $k$ is greater than or equal to $v$.\nWe assume that in the array $nums$, there is a subarray with length $j$, the elements are $a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_j$, and its average value is greater than or equal to $v$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_j}{j} \\geq v\n$$\nThen,\n$$\na_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_j \\geq v \\times j\n$$\nThat is,\n$$\n(a_1 - v) + (a_2 - v) + \\cdots + (a_j - v) \\geq 0\n$$\nWe can find that if we subtract $v$ from each element in the array $nums$, the original problem is transformed into a problem of whether the sum of the elements of a subarray with length greater than or equal to $k$ is greater than or equal to $0$. We can use a sliding window to solve this problem.\nFirst, we calculate the sum $s$ of the differences between the first $k$ elements and $v$. If $s \\geq 0$, it means that there exists a subarray with length greater than or equal to $k$ whose element sum is greater than or equal to $0$.\nOtherwise, we continue to traverse the element $nums[j]$. Suppose the current sum of the differences between the first $j$ elements and $v$ is $s_j$. Then we can maintain the minimum value $mi$ of the sum of the differences between the prefix sum and $v$ in the range $[0,..j-k]$. If $s_j \\geq mi$ exists, it means that there exists a subarray with length greater than or equal to $k$ whose element sum is greater than or equal to $0$, and we return $true$.\nOtherwise, we continue to traverse the element $nums[j]$ until the entire array is traversed.\nThe time complexity is $O(n \\times \\log M)$, where $n$ and $M$ are the length of the array $nums$ and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.

At this time, if the top element of the stack is equal to $-x$, then the two asteroids will explode, and we only need to pop the top element of the stack; if the stack is empty, or the top element of the stack is less than $0$, then the current asteroid will not collide, we will push $x$ into the stack.\n\nFinally, we return the elements in the stack as the answer.\nThe time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.

Each time, the truck will take out several consecutive boxes in order, then deliver them to the corresponding docks one by one. After all are delivered, it returns to the warehouse.\nTherefore, we can enumerate the index $j$ of the last box transported in the last trip. Then $f[i]$ can be transferred from $f[j]$. During the transfer, we need to consider the following issues:\n\nWhen transferring from $f[j]$, the number of boxes on the truck cannot exceed $maxBoxes$\nWhen transferring from $f[j]$, the total weight of the boxes on the truck cannot exceed $maxWeight$\n\nThe state transition equation is:\n$$\nf[i] = \\min_{j \\in [i - maxBoxes, i - 1]} \\left(f[j] + \\sum_{k = j + 1}^i \\textit{cost}(k)\\right)\n$$\nWhere $\\sum_{k = j + 1}^i \\textit{cost}(k)$ represents the number of trips required to deliver the boxes in $[j+1,..i]$ to their corresponding docks in one trip. This part of the trip count can be quickly calculated using prefix sums.\nFor example, suppose we take out boxes $1, 2, 3$ and need to deliver them to docks $4, 4, 5$. We first go from the warehouse to dock $4$, then from dock $4$ to dock $5$, and finally from dock $5$ back to the warehouse. It can be seen that it takes $2$ trips to go from the warehouse to the dock and from the dock back to the warehouse. The number of trips from dock to dock depends on whether the two adjacent docks are the same. If they are not the same, the number of trips will increase by $1$, otherwise it remains the same.

The number of cities is $n$, so we can pass at most $n - 1$ roads. Therefore, if $k \\ge n$, we cannot meet the requirements of the problem, and we can directly return $-1$.\nIn addition, we can also find that the number of cities $n$ does not exceed $15$, which suggests that we can consider using the method of state compression dynamic programming to solve this problem. We use a binary number of length $n$ to represent the cities that have been passed, where the $i$-th bit is $1$ indicates that the $i$-th city has been passed, and $0$ indicates that the $i$-th city has not been passed yet.\nWe use $f[i][j]$ to represent the maximum travel cost when the cities that have been passed are $i$ and the last city passed is $j$. Initially, $f[2^i][i]=0$, and the rest $f[i][j]=-\\infty$.\nConsider how $f[i][j]$ transitions. For $f[i]$, we enumerate all cities $j$. If the $j$-th bit of $i$ is $1$, then we can reach city $j$ from other city $h$ through the road, at this time the value of $f[i][j]$ is the maximum value of $f[i][h]+cost(h, j)$, where $cost(h, j)$ represents the travel cost from city $h$ to city $j$. Therefore, we can get the state transition equation:\n$$\nf[i][j]=\\max_{h \\in \\textit{city}}{f[i \\backslash j][h]+cost(h, j)}\n$$\nwhere $i \\backslash j$ represents changing the $j$-th bit of $i$ to $0$.\nAfter calculating $f[i][j]$, we judge whether the number of cities passed is $k+1$, that is, whether the number of $1$s in the binary representation of $i$ is $k+1$.

For any legal stacking, if we rotate each box in it to \"length <= width <= height\", the stacking is still legal and can ensure the maximum height of the stacking.\nTherefore, we can sort all the sides of the boxes so that each box satisfies \"length <= width <= height\". Then we sort each box in ascending order.\nNext, we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.\nWe define $f[i]$ as the maximum height when box $i$ is at the bottom. We can enumerate each box $j$ above box $i$, where $0 \\leq j < i$.

Therefore, the minimum number of elements to be added equals the length of target minus the length of the longest common subsequence between target and arr.\nHowever, the time complexity of finding the longest common subsequence is $O(m \\times n)$, which cannot pass this problem. We need to change our approach.\nWe can use a hash table to record the index of each element in the target array, then iterate through the arr array. For each element in the arr array, if the hash table contains that element, we add the index of that element to an array. This gives us a new array nums, which represents the indices in the target array of elements from arr (excluding elements not in target). The length of the longest increasing subsequence of this array nums is the length of the longest common subsequence between target and arr.\nTherefore, the problem is transformed into finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the nums array.

There are two situations:\n\nThe first element of the permutation is less than $perm[0]$, there are $(perm[0] - 1) \\times (n-1)!$ permutations.\nThe first element of the permutation is equal to $perm[0]$, we need to continue to consider the second element, and so on.\nThe sum of all situations is the answer.\n\nWe can use a binary indexed tree to maintain the number of elements that are smaller than the current element in the traversed elements. For the $i$-th element of the given permutation, the number of remaining elements that are smaller than it is $perm[i] - 1 - tree.query(perm[i])$, and the number of permutation types is $(perm[i] - 1 - tree.query(perm[i])) \\times (n-i-1)!$, which is added to the answer.

For each $t = \\frac{l + r}{2}$, we check whether we can mark all indices within $t$ seconds. If we can, we move the right boundary to $t$, otherwise we move the left boundary to $t + 1$. Finally, we judge whether the left boundary is greater than $m$, if it is, return $-1$, otherwise return the left boundary.\nThe key to the problem is how to judge whether we can mark all indices within $t$ seconds. We can use an array $last$ to record the latest time each index needs to be marked, use a variable $decrement$ to record the current number of times that can be reduced, and use a variable $marked$ to record the number of indices that have been marked.\nWe traverse the first $t$ elements of the array changeIndices, for each element $i$, if $last[i] = s$, then we need to check whether $decrement$ is greater than or equal to $nums[i - 1]$, if it is, we subtract $nums[i - 1]$ from $decrement$, and add one to $marked$; otherwise, we return False.

Optimizing this process through Alien DP, given the Monge property \\(c(i,l)+c(j,k) \\geq c(i,k) + c(j,l)\\), leads to a faster solution. Various methods such as divide-and-conquer, monotone minima, and convex hull trick are used to find the solution effectively.\n\nUltimately, the problem can be approached by:\n\n- Precomputing necessary sums for costs.\n- Leveraging Monge properties to run efficient dynamic programming.\n- Applying optimizations like divide-and-conquer, SMAWK, and convex hull trick for complexity reduction.\n\nThe primary goal of these methods is to manage the operations within a computational time limit for successful execution.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc360_g", "abc355_g"]}, "abc301_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a sequence \\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N) \\) of length \\( N \\) and a sequence \\( B = (B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_M) \\) of length \\( M \\).

For two sequences \\(a, b\\), define the XOR convolution as \\((a \\ast b)_k = \\sum_{i \\oplus j = k} a_i \\times b_j\\). \n\nCompute the XOR convolution \\(V = v_1 \\ast v_2 \\ast \\cdots \\ast v_N\\).

When \\(k = 1, 3\\), the contribution from the even elements of \\(a\\) is uniquely determined, because the type (mountain or valley) of the fold at position \\(a_x + i\\) depends only on \\(i \\bmod 4\\).\n\nFor elements whose contribution is not uniquely determined\u2014namely, the even elements when \\(k = 0, 2\\), and the odd elements when \\(k = 1, 3\\)\u2014extract and divide them by \\(2\\) (rounded down) to form a sequence \\(b = (b_1, b_2, \\dots ,b_l)\\). The contribution of these elements is counted recursively as \\(\\max \\left( f\\left( b, \\left\\lceil \\frac{k}{2} \\right\\rceil \\right),\\ f\\left( b, \\left\\lceil \\frac{k}{2} \\right\\rceil + 2 \\right) \\right)\\). This recursive structure of the creases and the fact that 100 operations is sufficiently many in regard to the constraints make the approach viable.\n\nElements derived from a particular element of \\(A\\) appear in \\(a\\) at most \\(\\log_2 \\max A\\) times during recursion, making this solution efficient. With appropriate implementation, the computational complexity is \\(O(N \\log \\max A)\\).\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nProblem Statement:\nYou are given a horizontally written text.

Using binary search, it is sufficient to solve the following decision problem (fast): Can the \\(N\\) pieces be divided into \\(K\\) segments so that each segment has a mass of at least \\(X\\)? If possible, how many cut lines are never used by any division among such ways?\n\nFor each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq N\\), let us consider whether there exists a conforming division that uses cut line \\(i\\). Let us redefine the sequence \\(A\\) of length \\(2N\\) by letting \\(A_{N + i} \\coloneqq A_i\\) for all \\(i\\) with \\(1 \\leq i \\leq N\\). If there exists \\(j (\\leq 2N + 1)\\) such that \\(A_i + A_{i + 1} + \\ldots + A_{j - 1}  \\geq X\\), let \\(f(i)\\) be the minimum such \\(j\\); otherwise, let \\(f(i) = \\infty\\). Also, let \\(f(\\infty) = \\infty\\). Using the sliding window trick, \\(f\\) can be evaluated for all arguments in a total of \\(O(N)\\) time.\n\nThere exists a conforming division that uses cut line \\(i\\) if and only if \\(f^K(i + 1) \\leq N + i + 1\\). \\(f^K\\) can be evaluated in \\(O(N \\log K)\\) time using the doubling technique based on \\(f^2, f^4, f^8, \\ldots\\). Therefore, the number of \\(i\\) for which there is a division that uses cut line \\(i\\) can be counted in \\(O(N \\log K)\\) time. Noticing that there is at least one \\(i\\) such that cut line \\(i\\) is used by a division if and only if the \\(N\\) pieces can be divided into \\(K\\) segments so that each segment has a mass of at least \\(K\\), this also solves the decision problem.\n\nAlternatively, evaluating \\(f^K\\) can be boiled down to the Level Ancestor Problem in a tree which has an edge between \\(i\\) and \\(f(i)\\) for each \\(i\\) with \\(i \\neq f(i)\\), so the decision problem can be solved in \\(O(N)\\) time too.

We will perform operation 1 as needed and consider the following operations:\n\nOperation A: When the piece and the gate are on the same vertex, move both the piece and the gate to an adjacent vertex. Operation B: Move the piece to an adjacent vertex. Operation C: Move the piece to the vertex where the gate is located.\n\nOperations A and B each incur a cost of 1. Once operation B is performed, the gate remains in its position until operation C is performed. It's inefficient to move the piece to the gate using operation B, so we will not consider this.\n\nLet \\(v\\) be the initial position of the piece and gate. By performing operation C at the end, the process ends when the piece and the gate are on the same vertex. Label the vertices and edges the gate moves to with A, and the rest with B. The vertices and edges labeled A form a connected subgraph, or subtree A. Vertex \\(v\\) is included in subtree A. Edges labeled B with one endpoint as A are boundary edges.\n\nVertices and edges labeled B not connected to boundary edges form connected components. Each component is a tree connected to a vertex in subtree A by a boundary edge \\(e_i\\). Let them form subtree \\(B_i\\), connected to vertex \\(l_i\\) in A.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. In optimal operations, assume edges labeled A are not traversed by operation B. By rearranging operations, the cost does not increase:\n\n   - The piece and gate start from \\(v\\), visit all vertices in A using operation A, and return to \\(v\\). This is the journey in A.\n   - If \\(l_i\\) is visited during A's journey, it's interrupted. The piece starts from \\(l_i\\), visits all vertices in \\(B_i\\) using operation B, and returns to \\(l_i\\). This is the journey in \\(B_i\\). The gate stays at \\(l_i\\).\n\n2. Assume moving along boundary edge \\(e_i\\) occurs only once in B's journey. If done more than once, moving with the gate using operation A during the first move and returning does not increase the cost. In \\(B_i\\)'s journey, operation C is done once at the end.\n\n3. In the journeys of A and \\(B_i\\), the farthest vertex is visited last. If the distance from start to the farthest vertex is \\(d\\) and the number of edges is \\(m\\), the cost is \\(2m - d\\).\n\nThe total number of edges in subtrees is \\(N-1\\). Minimize cost by maximizing \\(d\\)'s total sum. Calculate for fixed \\(v\\) using tree DP. Maintain:\n\n- Maximum distance to vertex where \\(B_i\\)'s journey ends, assuming \\(u = l_i\\).\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex not in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n\nExtend to rerooting DP to examine all possible starting vertices.

It is possible to turn \\(A\\) into a good sequence through operations.\n\nProof: If we can make \\(A\\) into a good sequence, then \\(A\\) can be made into a non-decreasing sequence. Suppose we transform \\(A\\) into a non-decreasing sequence. After that, we can perform operations to transform \\(A\\) into a good sequence:\n\nInvariant: Initially, the sequence \\((A_1)\\) is a good sequence, and \\(A\\) is non-decreasing. For \\(i = 2, 3, \\dots, N\\), do the following:\n\nInvariant: \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1})\\) is a good sequence. While \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) is not a good sequence, find exactly one position \\(j\\) \\((1 \\leq j \\leq i-1)\\) where adding \\(1\\) to \\(A_j\\) maintains \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1})\\) as a good sequence. Perform the operation on \\((j, i)\\).\n\nRepeat the operation until \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) becomes a good sequence. \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) becomes a good sequence if \\(A_{i-1}\\) and \\(A_i\\) coincide, reducing the difference by \\(1\\) or \\(2\\). If it is not obtained, choosing \\(j = i - 1\\) when the difference is \\(1\\) results in \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1}, A_i) = (x, x, \\dots, x, x+1)\\), which is a good sequence, so no operation is performed.\n\nAfter the operation, \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) is a good sequence, and \\(A_i \\leq A_{i+1}\\), so \\(A\\) remains non-decreasing.\n\nThus, the two propositions are equivalent. We can determine if \\(A\\) can become a good sequence in \\(\\mathrm{O}(N)\\) time using cumulative sums, solving this problem in \\(\\mathrm{O}(N)\\) per test case.\n        [END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc177_e", "arc185_b"]}, "abc303_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given two permutations \\( P = (P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_N) \\) and \\( Q = (Q_1, Q_2, \\dots, Q_N) \\) of \\( (1, 2, \\dots, N) \\).\n\nWrite one of the characters '0' and '1' in each cell of an \\( N \\)-by-\\( N \\) grid so that all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.

We assume the knowledge of cumulative sums for a sequence (one-dimensional cumulative sums).\n\nGiven a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(A\\), process \\(Q\\) queries. In the \\(i\\)-th query, given an integer pair \\((L_i,R_i)\\) satisfying \\(1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N\\), find \\(\\sum_{k=L_i}^{R_i}A_k\\).\n\nA solution to this problem is as follows: Define a length-\\((N+1)\\) sequence \\(S=(S_0,S_1,\\ldots S_N)\\) by \\(S_0=0,S_i=\\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}A_k\\), and use \\(\\sum_{k=L_i}^{R_i}A_k=S_{R_i+1}-S_{L_i}\\) to answer the query fast. The sequence \\(S\\) is called the cumulative sums of \\(A\\).\n\nThe original problem is an extension of this one-dimensional cumulative sum problem into three dimensions.\n\nConsider \\(S\\) such that \\(S_{i,j,k}=\\sum_{x=1}^{i-1} \\sum_{y=1}^{j-1}\\sum_{z=1}^{k-1}A_{x,y,z}\\) for \\(1 \\leq i,j,k \\leq N+1\\). If \\(i\\), \\(j\\), or \\(k\\) is \\(0\\), define \\(S_{i,j,k}=0\\).\n\nIt holds that \\(\\sum_{x=Lx_i}^{Rx_i} \\sum_{y=Ly_i}^{Ry_i} \\sum_{z=Lz_i}^{Rz_i} A_{x,y,z}=S_{Rx_i+1,Ry_i+1,Rz_i+1}-S_{Lx_i,Rx_i+1,Rz_i+1}-S_{Rx_i+1,Ly_i,Rz_i+1}-S_{Rx_i+1,Ry_i+1,Lz_i}+S_{Lx_i,Ly_i,Rz_i+1}+S_{Lx_i,Ry_i+1,Lz_i}+S_{Rx_i+1,Ly_i,Lz_i}-S_{Lx_i,Ly_i,Lz_i}\\).\n\nTherefore, if one can compute \\(S\\) fast, then each query can be answered in constant time.\n\n\\(S\\) can be found by the property that \\(S_{i,j,k}=S_{i-1,j,k}+S_{i,j-1,k}+S_{i,j,k-1}-S_{i-1,j-1,k}-S_{i-1,j,k-1}-S_{i,j-1,k-1}+S_{i-1,j-1,k-1}+A_{i-1,j-1,k-1}\\).

Thus, one can solve this problem by counting for each of the eight \\(1 \\times 1\\) squares how many instances of them are contained in the given rectangle. In order to count the number of squares at each position, it may be difficult to handle boundaries. As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\). Do the same thing for the \\(y\\) axis.\n\nAlso, when debugging this type of problem, it is effective to generate cases by yourself. In this problem, if it is a boundary issue that matters, it is a good idea to try many cases for \\(0 \\leq A, B, C, D \\leq 8\\).\n\nSample code (Python):\n```python\nmass = [[2, 1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 2, 1, 0]]\n# mass[i][j] : area of rectangle [[j, j + 1], [i, i + 1]] x 2\n\ninf = 4000000000\n\n# input\na, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n\n# calculation\nans = 0\nfor fy in range(2):\n    for fx in range(4):\n        x1 = (a - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        x2 = (c - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        count_x = x2 - x1  # count along x axis\n        y1 = (b - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        y2 = (d - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        count_y = y2 - y1  # count along y axis\n        ans += count_x * count_y * mass[fy][fx]\n\n# output\nprint(ans)\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc356_e", "abc354_d"]}, "abc305_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nYou are given an integer sequence \\( A \\) of length \\( N \\).

If it is possible, find the minimum number of seconds required.\n\nTakahashi can freely combine different swimming styles, and the time to switch styles is negligible. Specifically, he can swim using the following steps:\n- Choose a positive integer \\( m \\), a sequence of positive real numbers \\( t = (t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_m) \\) of length \\( m \\), and a sequence of integers \\( x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m) \\) of length \\( m \\) where each element is between \\( 1 \\) and \\( N \\), inclusive.\n- Then, swim in the \\( x_i \\)-th style for \\( t_i \\) seconds in the order \\( i = 1, 2, \\dots, m \\).\n\n**Constraints:**\n- All input values are integers.\n- \\( 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq 10^9 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq Q \\leq 2 \\times 10^5 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq C_i, D_i \\leq 10^9 \\)\n\n**Input:**\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n```\nN\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n...\nA_N B_N\nQ\nC_1 D_1\nC_2 D_2\n...\nC_Q D_Q\n```\n\n**Output:**\nPrint \\( Q \\) lines in total.

Choose \\( t = (1,2) \\) and \\( x = (2,1) \\). Takahashi swims as follows:\n  - In the first 1 second, he consumes 2 stamina and advances 3 meters.\n  - In the next 2 seconds, he consumes 2 stamina and advances 4 meters.\n  - In total, he consumes 4 stamina and advances 7 meters. The required time is 3 seconds, which is the minimum.\n- For the second query, \\( C_2 = 7, D_2 = 7 \\). Choose \\( t = (7/4) \\) and \\( x = (4) \\). Takahashi swims as follows:\n  - In the first 7/4 seconds, he consumes 7 stamina and advances 7 meters.\n  - In total, he consumes 7 stamina and advances 7 meters. The required time is 7/4 seconds, which is the minimum.\n- For the third query, \\( C_3 = 49, D_3 = 100 \\). No matter how Takahashi swims, it is not possible to advance 100 meters while keeping the total stamina consumption at most 49.\n- For the fourth query, \\( C_4 = 1000, D_4 = 500 \\). Choose \\( t = (125) \\) and \\( x = (4) \\). Takahashi swims as follows:\n  - In the first 125 seconds, he consumes 500 stamina and advances 500 meters.\n  - In total, he consumes 500 stamina and advances 500 meters.

The required time is 3/2 seconds, which is the minimum.\n\nSolution:\n\n```\nEditorial - AtCoder Beginner Contest 356\n\nConsider the case where Takahashi can swim using two styles: consume stamina of \\(A_1\\) to advance \\(B_1\\) meters per second or consume stamina of \\(A_2\\) to advance \\(B_2\\) meters per second. He can combine these styles to swim by consuming stamina of \\(tA_1+(1-t)A_2\\) to advance \\(tB_1+(1-t)B_2\\) meters per second. This corresponds to points on the segment connecting \\((B_1,A_1)\\) and \\((B_2,A_2)\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\nIf there are \\(N\\) points \\((B_i,A_i)\\), he can swim for any point inside or on the convex hull's boundary, but not outside it. Plotting the styles on the \\(xy\\)-plane assists in this determination. The most time-efficient point has the maximum \\(B_i\\), and the most stamina-efficient point has the minimum \\(A_i/B_i\\). If he can't swim \\(D_i\\) meters using the stamina-efficient point, the answer is -1.\n\nTo swim \\(D_i\\) meters within stamina \\(C_i\\), locate the rightmost point in the intersection of the convex hull's circumference and a line passing through \\((0,0)\\) and \\((D_i,C_i)\\). This represents viable swimming styles under the stamina constraint. He should trace the convex hull from the stamina-efficient point to the time-efficient point counterclockwise. Using binary search helps identify which segment it lies on and then pinpoints \\(P_{opt}\\)'s exact coordinates.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc177_c", "abc356_g"]}, "abc305_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nTakahashi eats three plates for breakfast: rice, miso soup, and salad.

Then, the two available operations become:\n\nAAA \u2192 A  \nBBB \u2192 B  \n\nWith this transformation, the solution becomes straightforward. For a contiguous segment of A or B, as long as its length does not become zero, we can reduce the length by 2 each time. For example, if there is a segment AAAAA, the possible final states are AAAAA, AAA, and A: there are three. Therefore, if the length of a segment of consecutive identical characters is L, the number of possible final states for that segment is floor((L+1)/2). For all segments of consecutive identical characters, the final states can be chosen independently. Thus, the product of the above values for all such segments is the answer to this problem.\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 200 points\n\nProblem Statement:\nIn the Kingdom of AtCoder, the eldest son is always given the name Taro.

It is possible to turn \\(A\\) into a good sequence through operations.\n\nProof: If we can make \\(A\\) into a good sequence, then \\(A\\) can be made into a non-decreasing sequence. Suppose we transform \\(A\\) into a non-decreasing sequence. After that, we can perform operations to transform \\(A\\) into a good sequence:\n\nInvariant: Initially, the sequence \\((A_1)\\) is a good sequence, and \\(A\\) is non-decreasing. For \\(i = 2, 3, \\dots, N\\), do the following:\n\nInvariant: \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1})\\) is a good sequence. While \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) is not a good sequence, find exactly one position \\(j\\) \\((1 \\leq j \\leq i-1)\\) where adding \\(1\\) to \\(A_j\\) maintains \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1})\\) as a good sequence. Perform the operation on \\((j, i)\\).\n\nRepeat the operation until \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) becomes a good sequence. \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) becomes a good sequence if \\(A_{i-1}\\) and \\(A_i\\) coincide, reducing the difference by \\(1\\) or \\(2\\). If it is not obtained, choosing \\(j = i - 1\\) when the difference is \\(1\\) results in \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1}, A_i) = (x, x, \\dots, x, x+1)\\), which is a good sequence, so no operation is performed.\n\nAfter the operation, \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) is a good sequence, and \\(A_i \\leq A_{i+1}\\), so \\(A\\) remains non-decreasing.\n\nThus, the two propositions are equivalent.

For details on lazy segment trees, please refer to other editorials and the AtCoder Library explanation. Specifically, for each segment \\(a\\cdot2^k+1\\leq i\\leq (a+1)2^k\\) for integers \\(a,k\\geq 0\\) and \\(2^k(a+1)\\leq N\\), we want to manage the sum of \\(A_i\\times B_i\\) within the segment, and apply addition to \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\) fast enough (in \\(O(1)\\) time). The set of actions consists of \u201cadding \\(x\\) to each element of \\(A\\) and \\(y\\) to that of \\(B\\) (within the segment)\u201d for all integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nFor a segment \\(a\\cdot2^k+1\\leq i\\leq (a+1)2^k\\) (where \\(L=a\\cdot2^k+1\\) and \\(R=(a+1)2^k\\)), it is insufficient to store the values \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\) for each segment. Instead, manage the length \\((R-L+1)\\), and three kinds of sum: \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R A_i\\), \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R B_i\\), and \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\), for each segment. Then, one can update the value \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\) in \\(O(1)\\) time. \n\nThe key updates are:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R ((A_i+x)\\times (B_i+y)) = \\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i) + y\\sum_{i=L}^R A_i + x\\sum_{i=L}^R B_i + (R-L+1)xy\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i+x) = \\sum_{i=L}^R A_i+(R-L+1)x, \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R (B_i+y) = \\sum_{i=L}^R B_i+(R-L+1)y\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the lazy segment tree can find the answer with a complexity of \\(O(Q\\log N)\\), which is efficient.

We perform the following operation 100 times: lift the right end and fold it so that it aligns with the left end using the center as a crease. After completing the 100 folds, we unfold the paper back to its original state. At this point, there are \\(2^{100} - 1\\) creases on the paper, which can be classified into two types: mountain folds and valley folds.

If we extract only the odd-numbered creases, the mountain and valley folds continue as VMVM.... If we extract only the even-numbered creases, this structure recurs. When grouping the creases based on the least significant bit that is 1 in the binary representation of their indices, each group forms a sequence like VMVM.... This can be proved using mathematical induction, among other methods, and is utilized in the solution.\n\nLet \\(f(a, k)\\) be the answer to the problem when taking \\(i\\) satisfying \\(i \\bmod 4 = k\\) for the sequence \\(a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots ,a_m)\\). When \\(k = 0, 2\\), the contribution to the answer from the odd elements of \\(a\\) is uniquely determined. When \\(k = 1, 3\\), the contribution from the even elements of \\(a\\) is uniquely determined, because the type (mountain or valley) of the fold at position \\(a_x + i\\) depends only on \\(i \\bmod 4\\).\n\nFor elements whose contribution is not uniquely determined\u2014namely, the even elements when \\(k = 0, 2\\), and the odd elements when \\(k = 1, 3\\)\u2014extract and divide them by \\(2\\) (rounded down) to form a sequence \\(b = (b_1, b_2, \\dots ,b_l)\\).

This recursive structure of the creases and the fact that 100 operations is sufficiently many in regard to the constraints make the approach viable.\n\nElements derived from a particular element of \\(A\\) appear in \\(a\\) at most \\(\\log_2 \\max A\\) times during recursion, making this solution efficient.

In this editorial, we introduce an approach that formalizes the problem as a cost-flow problem.\n\nThe problem involves preprocessing using segment-tree divide-and-conquer. For offline queries, you can simplify them using segment-tree divide-and-conquer. Queries consist of inserting tasks into a set and removing the last task inserted. Segment-tree divide-and-conquer helps manage these queries efficiently by converting removal queries to undo queries, maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nA segment tree is prepared to manage the timeline of queries. Each node of the segment tree stores a vector that manages elements. After preprocessing, elements are inserted into the segment tree nodes, and a DFS is performed to process these nodes. The complexity is \\(\\mathrm{O}(Q \\log T f(n))\\), with \\(Q\\) as the number of queries, \\(T\\) as the maximum time, and \\(\\mathrm{O}(f(n))\\) as the complexity of insertion and undo queries.\n\nFormalizing the problem as a cost-flow problem, insertions are represented as cost-flow in a graph. The problem is simplified to one kind of query: inserting a new task and printing the answer to the subproblem. If a negative cycle exists when an edge is added, remove the negative cycle with the smallest cost to maintain optimal flow in the graph.\n\nThis cost-flow problem can be rephrased using operations on task sets, representing graph flows with task insertions. Tasks inserted into the set \\(X\\) can potentially fulfill the deadlines. Operations for updating task sets are derived from negative cycle removal in the cost-flow graph.\n\nUsing Hall\u2019s marriage theorem and segment trees, a data structure is constructed to manage task sets efficiently, supporting task insertion and validity checks.

In this case, Takahashi alternates between moving to one of the leaf vertices and returning to vertex \\(0\\). We can consider the operation of going to a leaf and returning to the root as a single unit called a round trip. We consider the expected number of operations needed until all leaves are painted. When \\(i\\) leaves are already painted, the expected number of round trips needed until a new leaf is painted is \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\). Thus, the expected number of round trips until all leaves are painted is the sum of \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\) over \\(i = 0, 1, \\dots, N - 1\\). Each round trip requires \\(2\\) operations, and it is unnecessary to return to the root after all vertices are painted, so the answer is \\(\\left(\\frac{N}{N} + \\frac{N}{N - 1} + \\dots + \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{N}{1}\\right) \\times 2 - 1\\). Actually, we can handle a general \\(M\\) in the same way. Through some calculations, we find that the average number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\), and the rest of the argument proceeds similarly. Thus, the answer is \\(M^2\\) times the answer for the case \\(M = 1\\).\n\nThe fact that the expected number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\) can be shown by focusing on the depth of the vertex where he is on. By considering the depth, we essentially solve the problem: \u201cWhen performing a random walk on a path graph consisting of vertices \\(0, 1, \\dots, M\\) connected in this order, what is the expected number of steps needed to reach vertex \\(M\\) from vertex \\(0\\) and then return to vertex \\(0\\)?\u201d The answer to this problem is \\(2M^2\\).\n\nTherefore, we have solved this problem.

Starting from a state where no edge is added to the graph, inspect the edges in ascending order of weight. If the edge currently being inspected between vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) is not connected yet, add it to the graph. By managing the connectivity of the graph using a data structure like Disjoint Set Union (DSU), the algorithm runs in a total of \\(O(E\\log E)\\) time, where sorting is the bottleneck. (\\(E\\) is the number of edges.)\n\nIn this problem, there are at most \\(O((\\sum K)^2)\\) edges, making it infeasible to apply the algorithm directly within the time limit. Instead, we use the following property about the minimum spanning tree: if there is an edge \\(e=(u,v)\\) that satisfies the condition where there exists a path connecting vertex \\(u\\) and vertex \\(v\\) consisting of edges with weights not greater than that of edge \\(e\\), but not containing edge \\(e\\), removing edge \\(e\\) from the candidates does not change the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.\n\nThis is due to the behavior of Kruskal's algorithm. On edge \\(e\\)\u2019s turn, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are already connected, so edge \\(e\\) is never used. In this problem, the edges added are: an edge of weight \\(C_i\\) connecting vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) for all pairs of different vertices contained in \\(\\lbrace A_{i,1},A_{i,2},\\dots,A_{i,K_i}\\rbrace\\).\n\nBy the property above, we find it sufficient to add only the following edges: an edge of weight \\(C_i\\) connecting vertices \\(A_{i,1}\\) and \\(A_{i,j}\\) for each \\(j=2,3,\\dots,K_i\\). This modification reduces the total number of edges to \\(O(\\sum K)\\), making it feasible to apply Kruskal\u2019s algorithm to solve the problem.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nThere is a simple directed graph \\(G\\) with \\(N\\) vertices and \\(N+M\\) edges.

Thus, one can solve this problem by counting for each of the eight \\(1 \\times 1\\) squares how many instances of them are contained in the given rectangle. In order to count the number of squares at each position, it may be difficult to handle boundaries. As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\). Do the same thing for the \\(y\\) axis.\n\nAlso, when debugging this type of problem, it is effective to generate cases by yourself. In this problem, if it is a boundary issue that matters, it is a good idea to try many cases for \\(0 \\leq A, B, C, D \\leq 8\\).\n\nSample code (Python):\n```python\nmass = [[2, 1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 2, 1, 0]]\n# mass[i][j] : area of rectangle [[j, j + 1], [i, i + 1]] x 2\n\ninf = 4000000000\n\n# input\na, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n\n# calculation\nans = 0\nfor fy in range(2):\n    for fx in range(4):\n        x1 = (a - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        x2 = (c - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        count_x = x2 - x1  # count along x axis\n        y1 = (b - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        y2 = (d - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        count_y = y2 - y1  # count along y axis\n        ans += count_x * count_y * mass[fy][fx]\n\n# output\nprint(ans)\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc370_e", "abc354_d"]}, "abc308_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 600 points\n\nProblem Statement\n\nYou are given a simple undirected graph with \\(N\\) vertices and \\(M\\) edges.

The key corresponding to the character \\( S_x \\) is located at coordinate \\( x \\) \\((1 \\leq x \\leq 26)\\). Here, \\( S_x \\) denotes the \\( x \\)-th character of \\( S \\).\n\nYou will use this keyboard to input `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` in this order, typing each letter exactly once with your right index finger. To input a character, you need to move your finger to the coordinate of the key corresponding to that character and press the key. Initially, your finger is at the coordinate of the key corresponding to `A`. Find the minimal possible total traveled distance of your finger from pressing the key for `A` to pressing the key for `Z`. Here, pressing a key does not contribute to the distance.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( S \\) is a permutation of `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`.\n\n### Input\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n```\nS\n```\n\n### Output\n\nPrint the answer.\n\n### Sample Input 1\n```\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n```\n\n### Sample Output 1\n```\n25\n```\n\nFrom pressing the key for `A` to pressing the key for `Z`, you need to move your finger 1 unit at a time in the positive direction, resulting in a total traveled distance of 25.

Thus, the first line should contain 9.\n- After 2 years, the sea level is higher than now by 2, and \\((1,2)\\) sinks into the sea. This makes \\((2,2)\\) adjacent to a sunken section, and its elevation is not greater than 2, so it also sinks. No other sections sink at this point. Thus, two sections sink, and the second line should contain \\(9-2=7\\).\n- After 3 years, the sea level is higher than now by 3, and \\((2,1)\\) sinks into the sea. No other sections sink. Thus, the third line should contain 6.\n- After 4 years, the sea level is higher than now by 4, and \\((2,3)\\) sinks into the sea. No other sections sink. Thus, the fourth line should contain 5.\n- After 5 years, the sea level is higher than now by 5, and \\((3,2)\\) sinks into the sea. No other sections sink.

For each operation, we will refer to the former choice as the left operation and the latter choice as the right operation. Consider the relationship between operations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) for all integer pairs \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(1 \\leq i < j \\leq Q\\).\n\n- When \\(V_i \\leq V_j\\): Any choice is fine.\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i = P_j\\): No matter what, Snuke will cry during operation \\(j\\), so the answer is \\(0\\).\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i < P_j\\): Operation \\(i\\) must be a left operation, and operation \\(j\\) must be a right operation.\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i > P_j\\): Operation \\(i\\) must be a right operation, and operation \\(j\\) must be a left operation.\n\nAfter determining the direction of each operation in this way, if there is a contradiction, it is clear that the answer is \\(0\\). If there is no contradiction, the answer is at least \\(1\\). This is because, for any operation, the direction is set so that it can be performed after the previous operations. For those operations whose direction is not set, either choice is fine, so let \\(x\\) be the number of such operations, and the answer is \\(2^x\\) modulo \\(998244353\\).

The weight of the matching is the sum of the contributions of the edges. Removing an edge \\(i\\) from \\(T\\) splits it into two subtrees. If they have \\(c_i\\) and \\((N-c_i)\\) edges, the contribution of edge \\(i\\) never exceeds \\(\\min\\{c_i, N-c_i\\}\\).

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

We will try to exploit the special form of the graph to optimize Kruskal\u2019s algorithm against it. We first sort the edges by their costs and appropriately reassign indices so that \\(C_1 \\leq C_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq C_Q\\). According to Kruskal\u2019s algorithm, one can determine the minimum spanning tree as follows:\n\nPrepare an \\((N + Q)\\)-vertex graph without an edge. For \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots ,Q\\) in order:\n\nFor each \\(j = L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i\\) in order, add an edge between vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) of cost \\(C_i\\) if and only if vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are not connected.\n\nWhile it is still difficult to handle the conditions, one can notice that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are always disconnected if \\(j =L_i\\), and that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\((j - 1)\\) are connected if and only if vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are, in order to realize that it is sufficient to perform connectivity check for vertices with adjacent indices: \\(j - 1\\) and \\(j\\). Also, the graph is disconnected if and only if there exists an integer \\(j\\) between \\(1\\) and \\((N-1)\\) (inclusive) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected. Naively implementing this still costs \\(\\Theta(NQ + Q\\log Q)\\), but now that the problem is simplified, there are various approaches.\n\n(1) Use a set (or similar data structure) Manage the set of \\(1 \\leq j < N\\) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected in a data structure like the built-in set in Python, and remove those among \\(L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i - 1\\) that is not in the set. Naively checking the existence for each element still leads to TLE, but one can use a method such as bisect.bisect_left that retrieves the position of the minimum element greater than or equal to \\(x\\), as removal of an element occurs at most \\((N - 1)\\) times and the complexity is bounded by \\(O((N + Q) \\log N)\\), which is fast enough.\n\n(2) Use a lazy segment tree One can also use a lazy segment tree that supports segment-sum retrieval and segment-filling with \\(0\\). The \\(j\\)-th element of the lazy segment tree should be \\(0\\) if vertices \\(j\\) and \\((j+1)\\) are connected, and \\(1\\) otherwise. Initialize such a segment tree of length \\((N-1)\\) all with \\(1\\); then the number of edges connecting vertex \\(N + i\\) and any of vertices \\(L_i + 1, L_i + 2, \\ldots, R_i\\) can be retrieved as the segment sum of \\([L_i, R_i)\\), and adding an edge is fulfilled by filling \\([L_i, R_i)\\) with \\(0\\).\n\n(3) Use bitwise operations While a naive scan-based algorithm on an array results in TLE (Time Limit Exceeded), one can make use of bitwise operations with almost the same idea. The answer can be found fast enough by managing connectivity for each \\((j, j+1)\\) using the built-in int type in Python and using a function that returns the next position of \\(1\\) in the same way as found in (1), the answer can be found fast enough.\n        [END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc179_a", "abc364_f"]}, "abc310_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given \\(N\\) linear functions \\(f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N\\), where \\(f_i(x) = A_i x + B_i\\).

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem. The time complexity is \\(O(NK)\\) due to the bit-reversal calculation being the bottleneck.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n\n    def bit_reversal(x):\n        return int(bin(x)[2:].zfill(K - 1)[::-1], 2)\n\n    if N >= 2 ** (K - 1):\n        print(*[max(1, 2**K - i - 1) for i in range(N)])\n    else:\n        print(*[2 ** (K - 1) + bit_reversal(i) for i in range(N)])\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also solve it by constructing from the highest bit downwards.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    C = [1]\n    for _ in range(1, K):\n        D = [2 * c for c in C] + [2 * c + 1 for c in C]\n        C = D[:N]\n    while len(C) < N:\n        C.append(1)\n    print(*C)\n```\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou have an empty bag.

Both operations can increase or decrease the number of distinct numbers in the bag by one. Specifically, adding a ball increases the count by one or zero, and removing a ball decreases the count by one or zero. To determine if each operation affects the count, we need to check how many balls with a specific integer are in the bag. On insertion, if the bag already contains a ball with that number, the distinct count does not increase; otherwise, it increases by one. Similarly, on removal, the change in count depends on the number of balls with that specific integer. Thus, to process the queries, keep track of the current number of distinct integers with an integer and the number of balls with each integer in an array of length \\(10^6\\).

Define \\(C_i\\) as the number of subsequences of \\(A\\) with length as a multiple of \\(M\\) and total XOR equals \\(i\\).

For two sequences \\(a, b\\), define the XOR convolution as \\((a \\ast b)_k = \\sum_{i \\oplus j = k} a_i \\times b_j\\). \n\nCompute the XOR convolution \\(V = v_1 \\ast v_2 \\ast \\cdots \\ast v_N\\). The coefficient of \\(x^j\\) of the \\(i\\)-th term (\\([x^j]V_i\\)) equals the number of length-\\(j\\) subsequences of \\(A\\) with a total XOR of \\(i\\), resulting in \\(C_i = [x^0]V_i + [x^M]V_i + \\cdots = [x^0]V_i \\, (\\text{mod } 1-x^M)\\).\n\nUtilize Hadamard conversion \\(H\\), where \\(H(a \\ast b)_i = H(a)_i \\times H(b)_i\\).

A functional graph consists of connected components, each having exactly one cycle. The solution involves examining each connected component with a cycle and directed trees attached. For any vertex \\(u\\), all reachable vertices are either ancestors of \\(u\\) within its directed tree or part of the cycle that includes the root of this tree. To compute the reachable vertices, you should determine the depth of \\(u\\) in its directed tree and the number of vertices in the cycle using graph search algorithms like DFS. The algorithm's complexity is \\(\\mathrm{O}(N)\\), or alternatively, the SCC algorithm can be used.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc183_c", "abc357_e"]}, "abc310_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a simple undirected graph \\( G \\) with \\( N \\) vertices numbered from \\( 1 \\) to \\( N \\).

Rephrasing the operation with \\(Q\\) as the main focus, it becomes: Choose \\(i, j\\) such that \\(1 \\leq i < j \\leq N\\) and \\(Q_i - Q_j \\geq K\\). Here, the pair \\((Q_i, Q_j)\\) must not have been chosen before.

Performing the operation decreases the pseudo-inversion count by at least \\(1\\). It is possible to construct a sequence of operations that decreases the pseudo-inversion count by \\(1\\) each time. Specifically, proceed as follows: Iterate \\(x = 1, 2, \\cdots, N\\). Assume that, when processing a certain \\(x\\), the pseudo-inversion count of \\(Q_1, \\cdots, Q_{x-1}\\) is \\(0\\). Enumerate \\(Q_i\\) that satisfy \\(i < x\\) and \\(Q_i - Q_x \\geq K\\), and denote them as \\(i_1, i_2, \\cdots, i_s\\). Then, process \\((i_s, x), (i_{s-1}, i_s), \\cdots, (i_1, i_2)\\) in this order. This decreases the pseudo-inversion count by \\(1\\) with each operation. The same pair \\((Q_i, Q_j)\\) will not be operated on more than once. A straightforward implementation of these steps yields an \\(O(N^2)\\) time solution.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["agc067_a", "arc180_b"]}, "abc310_f": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere is an \\( N \\times N \\) grid, where the cell at the \\( i \\)-th row from the top and the \\( j \\)-th column from the left contains the integer \\( N \\times (i-1) + j \\).\n\nOver \\( T \\) turns, integers will be announced.

Let \\(dp[l][r]\\) denote the answer when considering only the interval \\([l,r]\\). We assume that when considering the interval \\([l,r]\\), only the intervals \\([L_i,R_i]\\) that satisfy \\(l \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq r\\) are given as conditions. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the values of \\(P_l,\\cdots,P_r\\) range from \\(1\\) to \\(r-l+1\\). Let\u2019s consider how to calculate \\(dp[l][r]\\).\n\nWe will do a case-by-case analysis based on the position \\(m\\) of the maximum value of \\(P_l,\\cdots,P_r\\). If there is a condition with \\(X_i=m\\), then that \\(m\\) is invalid. Consider the case without one. First, the conditions that satisfy \\(L_i \\leq m \\leq R_i\\) can be ignored from this point onward. This reduces the problem to calculating \\(dp[l][m-1]\\) and \\(dp[m+1][r]\\). Thus, we obtain the transition for \\(dp\\).\n\nNote that, since there is flexibility in the allocation of value sets to the left and right sides, it is necessary to multiply by the binomial coefficient corresponding to this.

Both operations can increase or decrease the number of distinct numbers in the bag by one. Specifically, adding a ball increases the count by one or zero, and removing a ball decreases the count by one or zero. To determine if each operation affects the count, we need to check how many balls with a specific integer are in the bag. On insertion, if the bag already contains a ball with that number, the distinct count does not increase; otherwise, it increases by one. Similarly, on removal, the change in count depends on the number of balls with that specific integer.

The key is to determine cycles in the permutation \\(P\\), and within each cycle, find the lexicographically smallest permutation. For a cycle with length \\(L\\), the number of minimal positions is \\(L / \\gcd(L, \\text{period})\\). We choose the minimal lexicographical arrangement by evaluating potential positions and adjusting the operation count \\(ans\\) accordingly. The process involves updating a result array based on minimized operations for each cycle, taking care of integer operations due to potential size. Here is the sample code:\n\n```python\nfrom math import gcd\n\nN = int(input())\nP = [int(x) - 1 for x in input().split()]\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nused = [False for i in range(N)]\n\nperiod = 1\nans = 0\n\nresult = [0 for i in range(N)]\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    if not used[i]:\n        cycle = [i]\n        while P[cycle[-1]] != i:\n            used[P[cycle[-1]]] = True\n            cycle.append(P[cycle[-1]])\n            \n        L = len(cycle)\n        choose = L // gcd(L, period)\n        offset = min((A[cycle[(ans + i * period) % L]], i) for i in range(choose))[1]\n        \n        ans += offset * period\n        period *= choose\n        \n        for i in range(L):\n            result[cycle[i]] = A[cycle[(i + ans) % L]]\n\nprint(*result)\n```\nThis effectively computes the lexicographically smallest permutation using the described method.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc366_c", "abc371_g"]}, "abc311_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nThere is a simple directed graph \\(G\\) with \\(N\\) vertices and \\(N+M\\) edges.

It can be further optimized: when \\(S_i\\) is replaced with \\(T_i\\), the string becomes larger if \\(S_i < T_i\\) and smaller if \\(S_i > T_i\\). Therefore, it's optimal to apply operations on the minimum \\(i\\) with \\(S_i > T_i\\). If there\u2019s no such \\(i\\), apply the operation against the maximum \\(i\\) with \\(S_i < T_i\\).

Editorial by evima\n\nSolution: Let\u2019s denote the \\(i\\)-th operation as operation \\(i\\). For each operation, we will refer to the former choice as the left operation and the latter choice as the right operation. Consider the relationship between operations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) for all integer pairs \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(1 \\leq i < j \\leq Q\\).\n\n- When \\(V_i \\leq V_j\\): Any choice is fine.\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i = P_j\\): No matter what, Snuke will cry during operation \\(j\\), so the answer is \\(0\\).\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i < P_j\\): Operation \\(i\\) must be a left operation, and operation \\(j\\) must be a right operation.\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i > P_j\\): Operation \\(i\\) must be a right operation, and operation \\(j\\) must be a left operation.\n\nAfter determining the direction of each operation in this way, if there is a contradiction, it is clear that the answer is \\(0\\). If there is no contradiction, the answer is at least \\(1\\). This is because, for any operation, the direction is set so that it can be performed after the previous operations. For those operations whose direction is not set, either choice is fine, so let \\(x\\) be the number of such operations, and the answer is \\(2^x\\) modulo \\(998244353\\).

We call those cells reachable to (-1,-1) \u201cinside,\u201d \nand unreachable \u201coutside.\u201d We first consider the case where the stones are connected in eight directions. \nBy enumerating eight cells around each cell beforehand, one can easily determine if these cells are inside or \noutside easily with BFS (Breadth First Search). The top-left cell is always outside; by performing BFS from this cell \nin four directions, one can reach all cells outside.\n\nExample: black cells represent lattice points with stones. Then, inspect each row. If there is a segment with \n\u201coutside stone inside \u2026 inside stone outside,\u201d then that segment can be counted as \u201cinside\u201d to count \u201cinside\u201d points. \nBeware of cases with consecutive stones, or stones between inside cells.\n\nNow we consider disconnected cases. It may seem we can consider each connected component independently, \nbut note that there may be a nested structure. After performing BFS for each connected component and determining whether \neach cell is outside or inside, when scanning the entire row, there may be parts like \n\u201coutside stone inside \u2026\u2026 outside stone inside \u2026\u2026 inside stone outside \u2026\u2026 inside stone outside,\u201d where some cells \ninside are labeled outside.\n\nEvery time you encounter \u201coutside, one or more stones, inside,\u201d the nest increases by one; for \n\u201cinside, one or more stones, outside,\u201d it decreases by one. By using this method to manage how many times the current \nposition is surrounded, one can handle this issue. Also, if there are different connected components sufficiently close \nto each other, the label (outside/inside) might be overwritten. This can be avoided by defining that stones are connected \nif the Chebyshev distance is two or less, instead of being eight-adjacent.\n'''\n```\n\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc182_a", "abc361_g"]}, "abc312_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nYou are given a string \\( S \\) of length \\( N \\) consisting only of lowercase English letters.

Since the number of sequences to print is always not more than this count, we do not have to worry about too much output.\n\n**Approach 1: Use recursion to enumerate**  \n1. Fix the first element in ascending order.  \n2. Once the first element is fixed, call the recursion to fix the second element in ascending order.  \n3. Once all the elements are ready, check if the total sum is a multiple of \\(K\\) and print it.  \n\nImplementing this recursion will be accepted.\n\nSample code (Python3):\n```python\ndef solve(lv, n, k, r, seq):\n    if lv == n:\n        s = sum(seq[:n])\n        if s % k == 0:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, seq[:n])))\n        return\n    \n    for i in range(1, r[lv] + 1):\n        seq[lv] = i\n        solve(lv + 1, n, k, r, seq)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    r = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))\n    seq = [0] * 8\n    solve(0, n, k, r, seq)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Approach 2: Decode integers corresponding to sequences**  \nIgnoring the condition \u201cmultiple of \\(K\\),\u201d there are \\(P=R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\dots \\times R_N\\) possible sequences. If you decode an integer between \\(0\\) and \\(P-1\\), the results are sorted in ascending order.\n\nLet \\(S\\) be the decode result. Prepare a variable \\(x \\leftarrow t\\). For \\(i = N\\) down to \\(1\\), do the following:\n1. Let \\(S_i \\leftarrow (x \\% R_i)+1\\). Then, replace \\(x\\) with \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{R_i}\\) (rounded down).\n\nIntuitively, a sequence corresponds to a special \\(N\\)-ary representation.\n\nSample code (Python3):\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    r = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))\n\n    tot = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        tot *= r[i]\n\n    for t in range(tot):\n        x = t\n        s = 0\n        seq = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            seq[i] = (x % r[i]) + 1\n            s += seq[i]\n            x //= r[i]\n        \n        if s % k == 0:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, seq)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc359_a", "abc367_c"]}, "abc312_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere are \\( N \\) servals on a bridge of length \\( L \\).

We will try to exploit the special form of the graph to optimize Kruskal\u2019s algorithm against it. We first sort the edges by their costs and appropriately reassign indices so that \\(C_1 \\leq C_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq C_Q\\). According to Kruskal\u2019s algorithm, one can determine the minimum spanning tree as follows:\n\nPrepare an \\((N + Q)\\)-vertex graph without an edge. For \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots ,Q\\) in order:\n\nFor each \\(j = L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i\\) in order, add an edge between vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) of cost \\(C_i\\) if and only if vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are not connected.\n\nWhile it is still difficult to handle the conditions, one can notice that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are always disconnected if \\(j =L_i\\), and that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\((j - 1)\\) are connected if and only if vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are, in order to realize that it is sufficient to perform connectivity check for vertices with adjacent indices: \\(j - 1\\) and \\(j\\). Also, the graph is disconnected if and only if there exists an integer \\(j\\) between \\(1\\) and \\((N-1)\\) (inclusive) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected. Naively implementing this still costs \\(\\Theta(NQ + Q\\log Q)\\), but now that the problem is simplified, there are various approaches.\n\n(1) Use a set (or similar data structure) Manage the set of \\(1 \\leq j < N\\) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected in a data structure like the built-in set in Python, and remove those among \\(L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i - 1\\) that is not in the set. Naively checking the existence for each element still leads to TLE, but one can use a method such as bisect.bisect_left that retrieves the position of the minimum element greater than or equal to \\(x\\), as removal of an element occurs at most \\((N - 1)\\) times and the complexity is bounded by \\(O((N + Q) \\log N)\\), which is fast enough.\n\n(2) Use a lazy segment tree One can also use a lazy segment tree that supports segment-sum retrieval and segment-filling with \\(0\\). The \\(j\\)-th element of the lazy segment tree should be \\(0\\) if vertices \\(j\\) and \\((j+1)\\) are connected, and \\(1\\) otherwise. Initialize such a segment tree of length \\((N-1)\\) all with \\(1\\); then the number of edges connecting vertex \\(N + i\\) and any of vertices \\(L_i + 1, L_i + 2, \\ldots, R_i\\) can be retrieved as the segment sum of \\([L_i, R_i)\\), and adding an edge is fulfilled by filling \\([L_i, R_i)\\) with \\(0\\).\n\n(3) Use bitwise operations While a naive scan-based algorithm on an array results in TLE (Time Limit Exceeded), one can make use of bitwise operations with almost the same idea. The answer can be found fast enough by managing connectivity for each \\((j, j+1)\\) using the built-in int type in Python and using a function that returns the next position of \\(1\\) in the same way as found in (1), the answer can be found fast enough.\n        [END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc357_f", "abc364_f"]}, "abc313_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThere are \\( N \\) villages on a number line.

For details on lazy segment trees, please refer to other editorials and the AtCoder Library explanation. Specifically, for each segment \\(a\\cdot2^k+1\\leq i\\leq (a+1)2^k\\) for integers \\(a,k\\geq 0\\) and \\(2^k(a+1)\\leq N\\), we want to manage the sum of \\(A_i\\times B_i\\) within the segment, and apply addition to \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\) fast enough (in \\(O(1)\\) time). The set of actions consists of \u201cadding \\(x\\) to each element of \\(A\\) and \\(y\\) to that of \\(B\\) (within the segment)\u201d for all integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nFor a segment \\(a\\cdot2^k+1\\leq i\\leq (a+1)2^k\\) (where \\(L=a\\cdot2^k+1\\) and \\(R=(a+1)2^k\\)), it is insufficient to store the values \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\) for each segment. Instead, manage the length \\((R-L+1)\\), and three kinds of sum: \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R A_i\\), \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R B_i\\), and \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\), for each segment. Then, one can update the value \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\) in \\(O(1)\\) time. \n\nThe key updates are:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R ((A_i+x)\\times (B_i+y)) = \\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i) + y\\sum_{i=L}^R A_i + x\\sum_{i=L}^R B_i + (R-L+1)xy\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i+x) = \\sum_{i=L}^R A_i+(R-L+1)x, \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R (B_i+y) = \\sum_{i=L}^R B_i+(R-L+1)y\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the lazy segment tree can find the answer with a complexity of \\(O(Q\\log N)\\), which is efficient.

So we can just let \\(x_i=i\\) and finally multiply the answer by \\(n!\\). Consider the uniqueness of bipartite graph matching. Fix a perfect matching; it is equivalent to not existing augmenting cycles. We claim that \\(l,r\\) is good if and only if there isn\u2019t \\(i,j\\) such that \\(1\\le i<j\\le n,r_i\\ge j,l_j\\le i\\). It means there is no cycle of length \\(2\\). Moreover, it can be proven that there will be no cycle under this condition. View \\(l\\) as constraints on \\(r\\), \\(\\forall l_i\\le j<i\\), then \\(r_j<i\\) must hold. Let \\(a_i=\\min\\limits_{l_j\\le i<j}j\\) (if \\(j\\) doesn\u2019t exist, then \\(a_i=n+1\\)). We need to calculate the sum of \\(\\prod (a_i-i)\\) for all possible sequences of \\(l\\). Fixing \\(a\\), we consider the number of \\(l\\) that generates \\(a\\). The main idea is to consider all maximums of \\(a\\) and divide \\(a\\) into several independent parts. Let \\(f_{i,j}\\) denote the answer when only considering \\([i,j]\\), requiring all \\(a_i\\dots a_j\\le j+1\\), with \\(l_{j+1}\\) determined (\\(l_{j+1}<i\\)).

Thus, we have:\n\n```python\ndef f_i_j(i, j):\n    return sum((j - k + 1) * g_i_k_1(i, k - 1) * f_k_1_j(k + 1, j) for k in range(i, j + 1))\n\ndef g_i_j(i, j):\n    return sum((k - i + 1) * (j - k + 1) * g_i_k_1(i, k - 1) * f_k_1_j(k + 1, j) for k in range(i, j + 1))\n```\n\nFurthermore, \\(f_{i,j}\\) is only related to \\(j-i+1\\), thus it can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\ndef f_i(i):\n    return sum((i - j + 1) * g(j - 1) * f(i - j) for j in range(1, i + 1))\n\ndef g_i(i):\n    return sum(j * (i - j + 1) * g(j - 1) * f(i - j) for j in range(1, i + 1))\n```\n\nBrute force runs in \\(O(n^2)\\) and is allowed to pass.

First, the integer \\( N \\) is given.\n2. Perform a comparison between \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\). The judge returns 1 because \\( X_1 < X_2 \\) (-1 < 10).\n3. Perform an addition of \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_3 \\). The judge erases \\( X_1 = -1 \\) and \\( X_3 = 1 \\) from the blackboard and writes \\( X_1 + X_3 = 0 \\). This is the fourth integer written.\n4. Perform an addition of \\( X_2 \\) and \\( X_4 \\). The judge erases \\( X_2 = 10 \\) and \\( X_4 = 0 \\) from the blackboard and writes \\( X_2 + X_4 = 10 \\). This is the fifth integer written.\n5. The blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\), so report this to the judge.\n\nSolution:\n\nBelow is the editorial as provided, since there's no code to translate to Python3:\n\n```\nAtCoder Regular Contest 179 - C: Beware of Overflow Editorial\n\nTo have only one integer on the blackboard, we need to perform exactly \\(N-1\\) additions. When there are two or more integers left on the blackboard, we should add the maximum and minimum values. The absolute value of their sum does not exceed \\(R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the multiset of integers on the blackboard, with maximum \\(M\\) and minimum \\(m\\). The absolute value of every element in \\(X\\) is at most \\(R\\), and \\(\\displaystyle\\left|\\sum_{x\\in X}x\\right|\\leq R\\).\n\n1. If \\(m \\geq 0\\), all integers are non-negative: \\(0 \\leq m + M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n2. If \\(M \\leq 0\\), all integers are non-positive: \\(0 \\geq m + M \\geq -R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n3. If \\(m \\leq 0\\) and \\(M \\geq 0\\), \\(-R \\leq m \\leq m + M \\leq M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n\nWe should add the maximum and minimum values. Use merge sort to arrange values in ascending order. Perform addition interactions to add the minimum and maximum values. Remove the first and last elements and insert the sum. Binary search determines the insertion position.\n\nEstimate interactions: Merge sort on a list of length \\(2^n\\) requires at most \\(a_n = n2^n\\) comparisons. Under \\(N \\leq 1000 \\leq 2^{10}\\), at most 10240 comparisons are needed. Finding insertion positions requires at most \\(10 \\times (N-1) \\leq 9990\\) comparisons. In total, at most 20230 comparisons plus \\(N-1 \\leq 999\\) additions remain well within the limit of 25000 interactions.\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nYou are given two integers \\( N \\) and \\( M \\).

If a good spanning tree exists, when we define the cost of an edge \\( (u,v) \\) as \\(|X_u - X_v|\\) using a strictly increasing sequence \\(X\\), the good spanning tree will be one of the minimum spanning trees. This follows from Kruskal's algorithm and the fact that for an edge \\( (u,v) \\) not included in the good spanning tree, the cost of the edges on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) will be less than \\(|X_u - X_v|\\). Specifically, if we consider setting \\(X_u = 10^u\\) or \\(-10^{N-u}\\), the costs of each edge will be distinct, so the minimum spanning tree will be uniquely determined. The good spanning tree will be equal to both of the following:\n\n1. The minimum spanning tree \\(T_1\\) when the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\) is \\((N+1)v - u\\)\n2. The minimum spanning tree \\(T_2\\) when the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\) is \\((N+1)(N+1-u) - (N+1-v)\\)\n\nTherefore, for a good spanning tree to exist, it is necessary that \\(T_1 = T_2\\). Conversely, in \\(T_1\\), for an edge \\((u,v)\\), the maximum vertex number on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be \\(v\\). In \\(T_2\\), for an edge \\((u,v)\\), the minimum vertex number on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be \\(u\\). Thus, the above conditions are also sufficient. From the above, the existence of a good spanning tree can be determined by finding \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) and checking if they are identical. Then, to determine the existence of a good spanning tree when each edge is removed, we can find the changes in the minimum spanning tree when the edge is removed and check for identicalness.\n\nFor the minimum spanning tree \\(T\\) of graph \\(G\\), the minimum spanning tree \\(T_{u,v}\\) of the graph obtained by removing edge \\((u,v)\\) can be obtained by the following steps:\n- If \\((u,v)\\) is not included in \\(T\\), then \\(T_{u,v} = T\\).\n- Otherwise, remove \\((u,v)\\) from \\(T\\). As a result, \\(T\\) will be divided into two connected components. Among the edges that span the two connected components, add the one with the minimum cost to \\(T\\) to obtain the tree \\(T_{u,v}\\).\n\nTherefore, we need to solve the following problem:\n\n1. For each edge \\(e\\) in the minimum spanning tree \\(T\\) of graph \\(G\\), initialize a variable \\(X_e\\) to \\(\\infty\\).\n2. For each edge \\((u,v)\\) in graph \\(G\\) that is not included in \\(T\\), update \\(X_e \\leftarrow \\min(X_e, C_{u,v})\\) (where \\(C_{u,v}\\) is the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\)) for each edge \\(e\\) included in the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in \\(T\\), and find the final values of \\(X_e\\).\n\nThis can be processed in \\(O(M \\log N)\\) time by handling range chmin queries with a segment tree while performing a DFS. Alternatively, by decomposing the tree into heavy and light paths and arranging the heavy paths, it can be converted into \\(O(\\log N)\\) range chmin queries, allowing it to be processed in \\(O(M \\log^2 N)\\) time, which is also sufficient.\n```\n\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc357_c", "arc181_e"]}, "abc314_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given positive integers \\( N \\), \\( L \\), and \\( R \\).

The dishes are numbered from 1 to \\(N\\), and dish \\(i\\) has a sweetness of \\(A_i\\) and a saltiness of \\(B_i\\).\n\nTakahashi can arrange these dishes in any order he likes. Snuke will eat the dishes in the order they are arranged, but if at any point the total sweetness of the dishes he has eaten so far exceeds \\(X\\) or the total saltiness exceeds \\(Y\\), he will not eat any further dishes.\n\nTakahashi wants Snuke to eat as many dishes as possible. Find the maximum number of dishes Snuke will eat if Takahashi arranges the dishes optimally.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- \\(1 \\leq N \\leq 80\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq 10000\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq X, Y \\leq 10000\\)\n- All input values are integers.\n\n**Input:**\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n```\nN X Y\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n...\nA_N B_N\n```\n\n**Output:**\nPrint the answer as an integer.\n\n**Sample Input 1:**\n```\n4 8 4\n1 5\n3 2\n4 1\n5 3\n```\n\n**Sample Output 1:**\n```\n3\n```\n\n*Explanation:*\nConsider the scenario where Takahashi arranges the dishes in the order 2, 3, 1, 4.\n- First, Snuke eats dish 2. The total sweetness so far is 3, and the total saltiness is 2.\n- Next, Snuke eats dish 3. The total sweetness so far is 7, and the total saltiness is 3.\n- Next, Snuke eats dish 1. The total sweetness so far is 8, and the total saltiness is 8.\n- The total saltiness has exceeded \\(Y=4\\), so Snuke will not eat any further dishes.\n\nThus, in this arrangement, Snuke will eat three dishes.

If all elements of \\(B\\) are positive, subtracting \\(1\\) from all elements can reduce \\(\\max(B)\\) without changing the sum of abs. When \\(B\\) is sorted in ascending order, the sum of abs can be expressed as follows: \n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^{L - 1}\\sum_{k = j + 1} ^ {L} |B_{j} - B_{k}| = \\sum_{j = 1}^{L - 1}\\sum_{k = j + 1} ^ {L} (B_{k} - B_{j}) =\\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} k(L - k)(B_{k + 1} - B_{k})\\]\n\nThis transformation is correct because \\(B_{a}-B_{b}=(B_{a}-B_{a-1}) + (B_{a-1}+B_{a-2}) + \\cdots +(B_{b+1}-B_{b})\\) for integers \\(a, b\\) satisfying \\(1\\leq b<a\\leq L\\), and the number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) satisfying \\(b\\leq k\\) and \\(k+1\\leq a\\) is \\(k(L-k)\\).\n\nIf we let \\(C_{k} = B_{k + 1} - B_{k}\\), then when \\(B\\) is sorted in ascending order and \\(B_{1} = 0\\), the following holds:\n- \\(0 \\leq C_{k}\\).\n- The sum of abs is equal to \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} k(L - k)C_{k}\\).\n- \\(\\displaystyle\\max(B) = B_{L} = \\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} C_{k}\\).\n\nTherefore, we need to solve the following problem: Determine if there exists a sequence of non-negative integers \\(C\\) of length \\(L - 1\\) such that \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} k(L - k)C_{k}  = A_{i}\\), and if it exists, find the minimum sum of such \\(C\\).\n\nThis can be solved using dynamic programming in the same manner as the knapsack problem, and it can be computed simultaneously for all \\(i\\).

Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and `dp[0][1] = dp[0][2] = ... = dp[0][N] = -float('inf')`.

It is possible to reconstruct a LIS. The complexity can be reduced to \\(O(N \\log N)\\) using a segment tree.\n\nThe DP can be efficiently implemented using pseudocode and a segment tree for segment-max retrieval, which allows LIS length to be obtained in \\(O(N \\log N)\\). Furthermore, by considering constrained LIS lengths `l_i` and `r_i`, and checking if `l_i + r_i - 1 = L`, where `L` is the LIS length, we can address this problem. `l` is found by memorizing DP results, and `r` by reversing the array and applying the same algorithm.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc181_d", "abc354_f"]}, "abc318_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a tree with \\( N \\) vertices.

Conversely, if neither \\(1\\) nor \\(N\\) is included in \\(A\\), a good permutation does exist. Let\u2019s consider this case. For example, if we set \\(P = (1, N, N - 1, N - 2, \\dots, 3, 2)\\), the only contiguous subsequence of \\(P\\) that includes both \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) is \\(P\\) itself, making \\(P\\) a good permutation. \n\nSince a good permutation with \\(P_{1} = 1\\) exists, the lexicographically smallest good permutation will have \\(P_{1} = 1\\). For any integer \\(x\\), if there exists a contiguous subsequence of \\(P\\) that is a permutation of \\((1, 2, \\dots, x)\\), it must be \\((P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{x})\\). We determine \\(P_{i}\\) for \\(i \\neq 1\\) in ascending order of \\(i\\). When deciding \\(P_{i}\\), assume that all of \\(P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{i - 1}\\) are at most \\(i\\). Let \\(a\\) be the number that is at most \\(i\\) and not included in \\(P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{i - 1}\\).\n\nWhen \\(i\\) is included in \\(A\\):\nTo make the permutation lexicographically smallest, set \\(P_{i} = i + 1\\). Since \\(P_{i}\\) is not greater than \\(i + 1\\), all of \\(P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{i}\\) will be at most \\(i + 1\\), and \\(a\\) does not change.\n\nWhen \\(i\\) is not included in \\(A\\):\nSet \\(P_{i} = a\\). Since this number is not greater than \\(i\\), all of \\(P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{i}\\) will be at most \\(i + 1\\), and \\(a\\) becomes \\(i + 1\\).\n\nThe time complexity is \\(O(N)\\).\n\n```python\n# input\nN, M = map(int, input().split())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nban = [0] * N\nfor a in A:\n    ban[a - 1] = 1\n\n# impossible\nif ban[0] or ban[N - 1]:\n    print(-1)\n    quit()\n\n# init\nP = [0] * N\nP[0] = 1\na = 2\n\n# calc\nfor i in range(1, N):\n    if ban[i] == 1:\n        P[i] = i + 2\n    else:\n        P[i] = a\n        a = i + 2\n\n# output\nprint(*P)\n```\n\nYou can also construct the permutation as follows: Initialize \\(P = (1, 2, \\dots, N)\\), and for \\(i = 2, 3, \\dots, N - 1\\), perform the following operation: If \\(i\\) is included in \\(A\\), do \\(\\text{swap}(P_{i}, P_{i + 1})\\).\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThere are \\( N \\) rest areas around a lake.

The interval \\([L_i, R_i]\\) represents the range within which \\(A_i\\) can seemingly move. However, some positions within this range may be fixed, meaning \\(A_i\\) actually cannot move there. The set of intervals \\([L_i, R_i]\\) is laminar, forming a tree-like structure without partial overlaps.\n\nWe process in descending order of \\(A_i\\), which equates to ascending order of \\([L_i, R_i]\\) size. Within \\([L_i, R_i]\\), we calculate where \\(A_i\\) can actually move by excluding fixed positions. Suppose there are \\(k\\) intervals in the subtree of \\([L_i, R_i]\\): if \\(R_i - L_i + 1 = k\\), these intervals fill \\([L_i, R_i]\\), fixing those positions. Hence, \\(A_i\\) can move within \\([l, r]\\), excluding fixed positions.\n\nThe actual available positions depend on those not occupied by previously processed values. The count of such positions determines the candidates for placing the current \\(A_i\\). This must be done for all \\(A_i\\), considering duplicate values by dividing by an appropriate factor. \\(L_i\\) and \\(R_i\\) can be found using binary search and interval LCA queries on \\(B\\), processed in \\(O(\\log M + \\log N)\\) time. This leads to a time complexity of \\(O(N + M\\log M(\\log M + \\log N))\\), which can be optimized by handling interval min query and LCA query in \\(O(1)\\) time.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given an integer sequence \\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N) \\) and an integer \\( X \\).\n\nPrint one triple of integers \\( (i, j, k) \\) satisfying all of the following conditions.

It is suboptimal for a resident to move luggage after a fellow resident of the same color. Utilize dynamic programming with states recording the current position, count of used Blue and Red residents, and current luggage holder. This yields  \\(\\mathrm{dp}[\\mathrm{pos}][b][r][\\mathrm{type}]\\) but results in an \\(O(N^3)\\) complexity, leading to time limit exceeded.\n\nStep 2:\nReduce state count by assuming residents more than two positions left don't touch luggage, resulting in \\(b \\geq b_{\\mathrm{left}}\\), \\(r \\geq r_{\\mathrm{left}}\\). Still results in \\(O(N^3)\\) complexity, leading to time exceedance.\n\nStep 3:\nFurther constrain by assuming residents over 20 positions to the right do not touch the luggage: \\(b \\leq b_{\\mathrm{left}} + 20\\), \\(r \\leq r_{\\mathrm{left}} + 20\\). The worst-case scenario involves 21 Blue at a single position, causing theoretical upper limit issues, but proven correct under \\(L \\leq 6 \\times 10^4\\).\n\nSample Implementation (C++):\nImplement the strategy noted above with an emphasis on memory and time management due to \\(O(N^3)\\) complexity states.

It is infinite when the total sum of \\(A\\) is not greater than \\(M\\), as the total cost required is never greater than \\(M\\). Conversely, if the total sum is greater than \\(M\\), setting the upper bound to the maximum value of \\(A\\) leads to exceeding the budget, so a maximum value exists.\n\nAssuming the answer is not infinite, a technique called binary search is effective for finding the maximum value subject to some condition. Given an upper bound \\(x\\), it can be determined if the total cost exceeds the budget in \\(O(N)\\) time. The number of iterations in the binary search is \\(O(\\log{\\max{A}})\\) because the upper bound of the answer is \\(\\max{A}\\).

Once all the elements are ready, check if the total sum is a multiple of \\(K\\) and print it.  \n\nImplementing this recursion will be accepted.\n\nSample code (Python3):\n```python\ndef solve(lv, n, k, r, seq):\n    if lv == n:\n        s = sum(seq[:n])\n        if s % k == 0:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, seq[:n])))\n        return\n    \n    for i in range(1, r[lv] + 1):\n        seq[lv] = i\n        solve(lv + 1, n, k, r, seq)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    r = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))\n    seq = [0] * 8\n    solve(0, n, k, r, seq)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Approach 2: Decode integers corresponding to sequences**  \nIgnoring the condition \u201cmultiple of \\(K\\),\u201d there are \\(P=R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\dots \\times R_N\\) possible sequences. If you decode an integer between \\(0\\) and \\(P-1\\), the results are sorted in ascending order.\n\nLet \\(S\\) be the decode result. Prepare a variable \\(x \\leftarrow t\\). For \\(i = N\\) down to \\(1\\), do the following:\n1. Let \\(S_i \\leftarrow (x \\% R_i)+1\\). Then, replace \\(x\\) with \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{R_i}\\) (rounded down).\n\nIntuitively, a sequence corresponds to a special \\(N\\)-ary representation.\n\nSample code (Python3):\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    r = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))\n\n    tot = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        tot *= r[i]\n\n    for t in range(tot):\n        x = t\n        s = 0\n        seq = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            seq[i] = (x % r[i]) + 1\n            s += seq[i]\n            x //= r[i]\n        \n        if s % k == 0:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, seq)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nYou are given \\( N \\) intervals numbered from 1 to \\( N \\).

The number of connected components in the undirected graph corresponds to the number of cycles in the directed graph, so we will focus on the latter.\n\n1. **When \\(\\gcd(N, A) \\neq 1\\):**\n\n   Let \\(f^N(x)\\) represent the vertex reached after \\(N\\) moves starting from vertex \\(x\\). We have \\(\\displaystyle f^N(x)\\equiv A^N x + B\\frac{A^N-1}{A-1}\\ \\text{mod}\\ N\\). Here, let \\(d = \\gcd(N, A^N)\\). Since \\(\\displaystyle f^N(x+1)-f^N(x)\\equiv A^N\\equiv 0\\ \\text{mod}\\ d\\), the vertices forming a cycle all match \\(f^N(0)\\) modulo \\(d\\). Considering only these vertices, the problem can be reduced to the case where \\(\\displaystyle(N, A, B) \\leftarrow \\left(\\frac{N}{d}, A \\mod \\frac{N}{d}, \\frac{A^N}{d}B \\mod \\frac{N}{d}\\right)\\). By performing this substitution, the problem can be reduced to the case where \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\).\n\n2. **When \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\):**\n\n   If \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\), all vertices form some cycle. Therefore, the answer is the sum of the reciprocals of the lengths of the cycles formed by each vertex. If vertex \\(x\\) returns to its original position after \\(K\\) moves, then \\(\\displaystyle A^K x + B\\frac{A^K-1}{A-1}\\equiv x\\ \\text{mod}\\ N\\), which implies \\(\\displaystyle A^K\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ \\frac{N(A-1)}{\\gcd(N(A-1), (A-1)x+B)}\\). Letting \\(G = \\gcd(A-1, B)\\), \\(A'=\\frac{A-1}{G}\\), \\(B'=\\frac{B}{G}\\), and \\(N'=\\frac{N}{\\gcd(A'^N, N)}\\), we have \\(\\displaystyle \\gcd(N(A-1), (A-1)x+B)=G\\gcd(N', A'x+B')\\). Since \\(A'\\) and \\(N'\\) are coprime, for each \\(0\\le y<N'\\), there exist exactly \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\) values \\(0\\le x<N\\) such that \\(y\\equiv A'x+B'\\ \\text{mod}\\ N'\\). Therefore, if we let \\(C_y\\) be the smallest positive integer \\(K\\) such that \\(\\displaystyle A^K\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ \\frac{NA'}{\\gcd(y, N')}\\) for each \\(0\\le y<N'\\), the desired answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\sum_{y=0}^{N'-1}\\frac{1}{C_y}\\). Values of \\(y\\) with the same \\(\\gcd(y, N')\\) have the same \\(C_y\\). Therefore, for each divisor \\(n\\) of \\(N'\\), we need to find the answer for \\(n = \\gcd(y, N')\\), and sum them up. The number of values \\(0\\le y<N'\\) such that \\(n = \\gcd(y, N')\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\left(\\frac{N'}{n}\\right)\\), so the answer can be expressed as \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\sum_{n| N'}\\frac{1}{C_n}\\phi\\left(\\frac{N'}{n}\\right)\\). Here, \\(\\phi\\) is the Euler\u2019s totient function.\n\nTo compute \\(C_n\\) for each \\(n\\), we can use the following facts:\n\n- By Euler\u2019s theorem, the candidates for \\(C_1\\) are divisors of \\(\\phi(NA')\\).\n- Let \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) be divisors of \\(N'\\). If \\(n_1\\) divides \\(n_2\\), then \\(C_{n_2}\\) divides \\(C_{n_1}\\).\n\nThis approach can be implemented using a DFS-like method. The value of \\(\\phi(NA')\\) and its prime factorization can be computed quickly by precomputing the prime factorizations of all positive integers up to \\(N\\).\n\n---\n\nThis concise editorial provides a clear breakdown of the problem-solving approach without unnecessary content.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nYou are given a sequence \\( A = (A_1, \\ldots, A_N) \\) of length \\( N \\).

If a good spanning tree exists, when we define the cost of an edge \\( (u,v) \\) as \\(|X_u - X_v|\\) using a strictly increasing sequence \\(X\\), the good spanning tree will be one of the minimum spanning trees. This follows from Kruskal's algorithm and the fact that for an edge \\( (u,v) \\) not included in the good spanning tree, the cost of the edges on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) will be less than \\(|X_u - X_v|\\). Specifically, if we consider setting \\(X_u = 10^u\\) or \\(-10^{N-u}\\), the costs of each edge will be distinct, so the minimum spanning tree will be uniquely determined. The good spanning tree will be equal to both of the following:\n\n1. The minimum spanning tree \\(T_1\\) when the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\) is \\((N+1)v - u\\)\n2. The minimum spanning tree \\(T_2\\) when the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\) is \\((N+1)(N+1-u) - (N+1-v)\\)\n\nTherefore, for a good spanning tree to exist, it is necessary that \\(T_1 = T_2\\). Conversely, in \\(T_1\\), for an edge \\((u,v)\\), the maximum vertex number on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be \\(v\\). In \\(T_2\\), for an edge \\((u,v)\\), the minimum vertex number on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be \\(u\\). Thus, the above conditions are also sufficient. From the above, the existence of a good spanning tree can be determined by finding \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) and checking if they are identical. Then, to determine the existence of a good spanning tree when each edge is removed, we can find the changes in the minimum spanning tree when the edge is removed and check for identicalness.\n\nFor the minimum spanning tree \\(T\\) of graph \\(G\\), the minimum spanning tree \\(T_{u,v}\\) of the graph obtained by removing edge \\((u,v)\\) can be obtained by the following steps:\n- If \\((u,v)\\) is not included in \\(T\\), then \\(T_{u,v} = T\\).\n- Otherwise, remove \\((u,v)\\) from \\(T\\). As a result, \\(T\\) will be divided into two connected components. Among the edges that span the two connected components, add the one with the minimum cost to \\(T\\) to obtain the tree \\(T_{u,v}\\).\n\nTherefore, we need to solve the following problem:\n\n1. For each edge \\(e\\) in the minimum spanning tree \\(T\\) of graph \\(G\\), initialize a variable \\(X_e\\) to \\(\\infty\\).\n2. For each edge \\((u,v)\\) in graph \\(G\\) that is not included in \\(T\\), update \\(X_e \\leftarrow \\min(X_e, C_{u,v})\\) (where \\(C_{u,v}\\) is the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\)) for each edge \\(e\\) included in the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in \\(T\\), and find the final values of \\(X_e\\).\n\nThis can be processed in \\(O(M \\log N)\\) time by handling range chmin queries with a segment tree while performing a DFS. Alternatively, by decomposing the tree into heavy and light paths and arranging the heavy paths, it can be converted into \\(O(\\log N)\\) range chmin queries, allowing it to be processed in \\(O(M \\log^2 N)\\) time, which is also sufficient.\n```\n\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given sequences of positive integers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) of length \\( N \\).

Using binary search, it is sufficient to solve the following decision problem (fast): Can the \\(N\\) pieces be divided into \\(K\\) segments so that each segment has a mass of at least \\(X\\)? If possible, how many cut lines are never used by any division among such ways?\n\nFor each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq N\\), let us consider whether there exists a conforming division that uses cut line \\(i\\). Let us redefine the sequence \\(A\\) of length \\(2N\\) by letting \\(A_{N + i} \\coloneqq A_i\\) for all \\(i\\) with \\(1 \\leq i \\leq N\\). If there exists \\(j (\\leq 2N + 1)\\) such that \\(A_i + A_{i + 1} + \\ldots + A_{j - 1}  \\geq X\\), let \\(f(i)\\) be the minimum such \\(j\\); otherwise, let \\(f(i) = \\infty\\). Also, let \\(f(\\infty) = \\infty\\). Using the sliding window trick, \\(f\\) can be evaluated for all arguments in a total of \\(O(N)\\) time.\n\nThere exists a conforming division that uses cut line \\(i\\) if and only if \\(f^K(i + 1) \\leq N + i + 1\\). \\(f^K\\) can be evaluated in \\(O(N \\log K)\\) time using the doubling technique based on \\(f^2, f^4, f^8, \\ldots\\). Therefore, the number of \\(i\\) for which there is a division that uses cut line \\(i\\) can be counted in \\(O(N \\log K)\\) time. Noticing that there is at least one \\(i\\) such that cut line \\(i\\) is used by a division if and only if the \\(N\\) pieces can be divided into \\(K\\) segments so that each segment has a mass of at least \\(K\\), this also solves the decision problem.\n\nAlternatively, evaluating \\(f^K\\) can be boiled down to the Level Ancestor Problem in a tree which has an edge between \\(i\\) and \\(f(i)\\) for each \\(i\\) with \\(i \\neq f(i)\\), so the decision problem can be solved in \\(O(N)\\) time too. However, in the writer\u2019s and tester\u2019s solution, it was the solution that used doubling.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc362_c", "abc370_f"]}, "abc323_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 100 points\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nTakahashi is planning to eat \\( N \\) dishes. \n- The \\( i \\)-th dish he plans to eat is sweet if \\( S_i = \\text{sweet} \\), and salty if \\( S_i = \\text{salty} \\). \n- If he eats two sweet dishes consecutively, he will feel sick and be unable to eat any more dishes. \n\nDetermine whether he can eat all the dishes.\n\n**Constraints**\n- \\( N \\) is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n- Each \\( S_i \\) is either \\text{sweet} or \\text{salty}.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is provided in the following format:\n\n```\nN\nS_1\nS_2\n...\nS_N\n```\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint `Yes` if Takahashi can eat all the dishes, and `No` otherwise.\n\n**Sample Input 1**\n```\n5\nsalty\nsweet\nsalty\nsalty\nsweet\n```\n\n**Sample Output 1**\n```\nYes\n```\n*Takahashi will not eat two sweet dishes consecutively, so he can eat all the dishes without feeling sick.*\n\n**Sample Input 2**\n```\n4\nsweet\nsalty\nsweet\nsweet\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2**\n```\nYes\n```\n*He will feel sick but can still eat all the dishes.*\n\n**Sample Input 3**\n```\n6\nsalty\nsweet\nsweet\nsalty\nsweet\nsweet\n```\n\n**Sample Output 3**\n```\nNo\n```\n*He feels sick when eating the 3rd dish and cannot eat the 4th and subsequent dishes.*\n\nSolution:\n\n        [BEGIN TEXT]\n        Japan Registry Services (JPRS) Programming Contest 2024#2 (AtCoder Beginner Contest 364)\n\nIf there exists an integer \\(i\\) between \\(1\\) and \\((N-2)\\) such that the \\(i\\)-th and \\((i+1)\\)-th dishes to eat are both sweet, he cannot eat the \\((i+2)\\)-th dish and cannot eat all of the dishes.

The set of intervals \\([L_i, R_i]\\) is laminar, forming a tree-like structure without partial overlaps.\n\nWe process in descending order of \\(A_i\\), which equates to ascending order of \\([L_i, R_i]\\) size. Within \\([L_i, R_i]\\), we calculate where \\(A_i\\) can actually move by excluding fixed positions. Suppose there are \\(k\\) intervals in the subtree of \\([L_i, R_i]\\): if \\(R_i - L_i + 1 = k\\), these intervals fill \\([L_i, R_i]\\), fixing those positions. Hence, \\(A_i\\) can move within \\([l, r]\\), excluding fixed positions.\n\nThe actual available positions depend on those not occupied by previously processed values.

An applicable tree with the minimum number of vertices does not have a bad vertex. If it has a bad vertex, the tree remains applicable even after removing that vertex. Hence, a minimal applicable tree does not have a bad vertex.\n\n2. An applicable tree without a bad vertex is minimal.

This graph is a tree. Let \\(D\\) be the diameter of this tree. The solution is \\(2\\sum C_i - D\\). The diameter of the tree can be found in \\(O(N)\\) time using the following steps: From an arbitrary vertex \\(v\\), find the furthest vertex \\(u\\). From \\(u\\), find the furthest vertex \\(s\\). \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the endpoints of a diameter.\n\nWe won't explain why the diameter can be found this way. The original problem's answer is \\(2\\sum C_i - D\\). Consider the minimum travel distance for visiting all vertices and returning to the start. For each edge, consider the two components obtained by removing the edge; every edge must be passed at least twice. By performing a DFS from an arbitrary vertex and visiting all vertices, you can return to the start after passing each edge twice. Thus, the answer is \\(2\\sum C_i\\).\n\nReturn to the original problem. A tour visiting every vertex once can be extended to return to the start. The minimum for this is \\(2\\sum C_i\\), while the maximum distance from end to start equals the tree's diameter. So, the minimum tour distance visiting all vertices at least once is \\(2\\sum C_i-D\\). \n\nChoose a diameter with endpoints \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). By performing DFS such that the next vertex doesn't move closer to \\(y\\), each edge on the shortest path between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is passed once. This tour visits each vertex once with travel distance \\(2\\sum C_i-D\\). Therefore, the sought minimum value is \\(2\\sum C_i-D\\).\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc185_c", "abc361_e"]}, "abc324_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given three sequences of positive integers each of length \\( N \\):  \n\\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N) \\),  \n\\( B = (B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_N) \\), and  \n\\( C = (C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_N) \\).  \n\nFind the number of pairs of positive integers \\( (x, y) \\) that satisfy the following condition for all \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq N \\):  \n\\[ A_i \\times x + B_i \\times y < C_i \\]\n\nIt can be proved that the number of such pairs of positive integers satisfying the condition is finite.\n\nYou are given \\( T \\) test cases, each of which should be solved.\n\n**Constraints**\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\times 10^5 \\)  \n- \\( 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5 \\)  \n- \\( 1 \\leq A_i, B_i, C_i \\leq 10^9 \\)  \n- The sum of \\( N \\) over all test cases is at most \\( 2 \\times 10^5 \\).  \n- All input values are integers.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is provided in the following format:  \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nT & \\\\\n\\mathrm{case}_1 & \\\\\n\\mathrm{case}_2 & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\\\\n\\mathrm{case}_T & \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nEach test case is given in the following format:  \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nN & \\\\\nA_1 & B_1 & C_1 \\\\\nA_2 & B_2 & C_2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\\\\nA_N & B_N & C_N \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint \\( T \\) lines.

In this case, Takahashi alternates between moving to one of the leaf vertices and returning to vertex \\(0\\). We can consider the operation of going to a leaf and returning to the root as a single unit called a round trip. We consider the expected number of operations needed until all leaves are painted. When \\(i\\) leaves are already painted, the expected number of round trips needed until a new leaf is painted is \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\). Thus, the expected number of round trips until all leaves are painted is the sum of \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\) over \\(i = 0, 1, \\dots, N - 1\\). Each round trip requires \\(2\\) operations, and it is unnecessary to return to the root after all vertices are painted, so the answer is \\(\\left(\\frac{N}{N} + \\frac{N}{N - 1} + \\dots + \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{N}{1}\\right) \\times 2 - 1\\). Actually, we can handle a general \\(M\\) in the same way. Through some calculations, we find that the average number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\), and the rest of the argument proceeds similarly. Thus, the answer is \\(M^2\\) times the answer for the case \\(M = 1\\).\n\nThe fact that the expected number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\) can be shown by focusing on the depth of the vertex where he is on. By considering the depth, we essentially solve the problem: \u201cWhen performing a random walk on a path graph consisting of vertices \\(0, 1, \\dots, M\\) connected in this order, what is the expected number of steps needed to reach vertex \\(M\\) from vertex \\(0\\) and then return to vertex \\(0\\)?\u201d The answer to this problem is \\(2M^2\\).\n\nTherefore, we have solved this problem.

For each \\(j=0,1,\\ldots,27\\), define a sequence \\(B\\) of length \\(N\\) such that \\(B_i=1\\) if the \\(j\\)-th bit of \\(A_i\\) is \\(1\\) and \\(B_i=0\\) if it is \\(0\\). Solve the problem against \\(B\\) for each \\(j\\), and the total sum of the answers multiplied by \\(2^j\\) is the solution to the original problem. This simplifies the problem as \\(B\\) takes only zero or one, as opposed to \\(A\\) taking variable values.\n\nNext, the expression \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (B_i \\oplus B_{i+1}\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus B_j)\\) requires the total XOR of a segment. This can be computed fast using cumulative XORs, similar to cumulative sums when computing the total sum on a segment. Define the array of cumulative XORs \\(C\\) by \\(C_0=0\\) and \\(C_i =B_1\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus B_i\\). Then \\(B_i \\oplus B_{i+1}\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus B_j = C_{i-1} \\oplus C_j\\).\n\nThe expression can be rewritten as follows:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i-1} \\oplus C_j)  = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2}\\sum_{j=i+2}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j). \\]\n\nAdjusting the index \\(j\\) to start from \\(i+1\\):\n\\[ \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2}\\sum_{j=i+2}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j) - \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (C_i\\oplus C_{i+1}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} B_i. \\]\n\nNow \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j)\\) is the number of pairs of elements in \\(C\\) with different values, which equals the product of the number of occurrences of \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) in \\(C\\). Thus, the sought value can be evaluated with the total sum of \\(B\\) and the number of occurrences of \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) in the cumulative XORs.

Given \\(k\\) coins \\((r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)\\), one can determine if there is a path that can collect all the coins as follows:\n\nSort the coins in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Here, \\((r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j) \\Leftrightarrow (r_i < r_j) \\lor (r_i = r_j \\land c_i < c_j)\\). Let \\(((r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k))\\) be the resulting sequence. There exists a path that can collect all the given \\(k\\) coins if and only if \\(c'_1 \\leq c'_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq c'_k\\).\n\nProof: If two coins $i$ and $j$ with $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$ are to be collected, coin $i$ has to be collected first. Thus, the $k$ coins $(r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)$ can be all collected if and only if the $k$ coins $(r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k)$ can be collected **in this order**. Given $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$, we have $(r_i \\leq r_j \\land c_i \\leq c_j) \\Leftrightarrow c_i \\leq c_j$, so the claim above has been shown.\n\nSuppose that the given \\(N\\) coins are sorted in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Then, by the fact above, this problem is boiled down to finding a longest (weakly) increasing subsequence (LIS). Given positive integer sequence \\(c=(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_N)\\), one can find the length of a LIS of \\(c\\) (not its length) by the following famous algorithm:\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\). Do the following for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\).\n\nFor the minimum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j > c_i\\), replace \\(d_j\\) with \\(c_i\\). The length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\).\n\nIntuitively, each \\(d_j\\) manages the smallest last element of a length-\\(j\\) (weakly) increasing subsequence of \\(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_i\\) (or \\(\\infty\\) if there is no such subsequence). To find an example of LIS instead of its length only, let us modify the algorithm as follows.\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\). Prepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(\\text{id}\\) and \\(\\text{pre}\\). Do the following for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\).\n\nFor the minimum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j > c_i\\), replace \\(d_j\\) with \\(c_i\\), and replace \\(\\text{id}_j\\) with \\(i\\). If \\(j > 1\\), replace \\(\\text{pre}_i\\) with \\(\\text{id}_{j-1}\\) too.\n\nThe length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\). Let \\(l\\) be the length of a LIS of \\(c\\). Consider a length-\\(l\\) sequence obtained by applying \\((l-1)\\) times the action \\(i\\mapsto \\text{pre}_i\\) to \\(\\text{id}_l\\), namely \\((\\text{id}_l, \\text{pre}_{\\text{id}_l},\\text{pre}_{\\text{pre}_{\\text{id}_l}},\\dots)\\). The reversal of this sequence is an example of a LIS of \\(c\\).\n\nThe fact that an example of LIS can be indeed obtained using this algorithm can be proved inductively. The complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(N\\log N)\\), same as the original algorithm. (To find the minimum \\(j\\) in step \\(3\\), use binary search.) Thus, the problem has been solved.\n\nSample code (Python3):\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_right\n\ndef main():\n    h, w, n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n    coins = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        coins.append((r, c))\n    coins.sort()\n    dp = [float('inf')] * n\n    id_list = [-1] * n\n    pre = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        it = bisect_right(dp, coins[i][1])\n        dp[it] = coins[i][1]\n        id_list[it] = i\n        pre[i] = id_list[it - 1] if it else -1\n    m = n - 1\n    while id_list[m] == -1:\n        m -= 1\n    path = [(h, w)]\n    now = id_list[m]\n    while now != -1:\n        path.append(coins[now])\n        now = pre[now]\n    path.append((1, 1))\n    path.reverse()\n    s = []\n    for i in range(len(path) - 1):\n        d = path[i + 1][0] - path[i][0]\n        r = path[i + 1][1] - path[i][1]\n        s.append('D' * d + 'R' * r)\n    print(m + 1)\n    print(''.join(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere are \\( N \\) servals on a bridge of length \\( L \\).

If we operate with \\( i=2 \\) and \\( j=3 \\), the value of \\( A_2 \\) will be changed to \\( A_3=2 \\), resulting in \\( A=(1,2,2) \\).\n\nSolution:\n\n```\nOfficial\n\nB - Near Assignment Editorial by evima\n\nIf \\(A = B\\), it is clearly possible, so we consider other cases. Consider two cases based on the value of \\(K\\).\n\nCase \\(K = 1\\): Considering the result of run-length encoding of the elements in \\(A\\), it can \u201cdecrease\u201d through operations, but not \u201cincrease.\u201d From this, we can deduce that the result of run-length encoding of \\(B\\) must be a subsequence of the run-length encoded \\(A\\). This condition is also sufficient because we can perform operations that extend the subsequence of \\(A\\) corresponding to \\(B\\). This solves the case where \\(K = 1\\).\n\nCase \\(K \\geq 2\\): Looking at the operations in reverse, they can be seen as follows:\n\nChoose \\(i,j\\) that satisfy \\(|i-j| \\leq K\\) and \\(B_i = B_j\\), then change \\(B_i\\) to any desired value. First, if no operation can be performed on \\(B\\), the answer is No. Also, if there is a value in \\(B\\) that does not appear in \\(A\\), the answer is No. Actually, in all other cases, the answer is Yes. Let\u2019s reinterpret the part where \\(B_i\\) can be changed to any desired value as an operation where \\(B_i\\) is changed to a wildcard \\(*\\). By performing one operation on \\(B\\), we create a state where there is exactly one \\(*\\). The involvement of \\(*\\) enables us to swap adjacent elements in \\(B\\).\n\nIf you want to change \\(*x\\) to \\(x*\\): think of \\(*x\\) as \\(xx\\) and perform the operation to turn it into \\(x*\\). If you want to change \\(*xy\\) to \\(*yx\\): follow the steps \\(*xy \\to yxy \\to yx* \\to y*x \\to *yx\\).\n\nBy combining these operations, you can remove all duplicates in \\(B\\) and arrange them in any desired order. In particular, you can arrange \\(B\\) to match \\(A\\). Therefore, it can be determined that \\(A\\) can be transformed into \\(B\\). Implementing the above operations directly yields an \\(O(N)\\) solution.

In this case, Takahashi alternates between moving to one of the leaf vertices and returning to vertex \\(0\\). We can consider the operation of going to a leaf and returning to the root as a single unit called a round trip. We consider the expected number of operations needed until all leaves are painted. When \\(i\\) leaves are already painted, the expected number of round trips needed until a new leaf is painted is \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\). Thus, the expected number of round trips until all leaves are painted is the sum of \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\) over \\(i = 0, 1, \\dots, N - 1\\). Each round trip requires \\(2\\) operations, and it is unnecessary to return to the root after all vertices are painted, so the answer is \\(\\left(\\frac{N}{N} + \\frac{N}{N - 1} + \\dots + \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{N}{1}\\right) \\times 2 - 1\\). Actually, we can handle a general \\(M\\) in the same way. Through some calculations, we find that the average number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\), and the rest of the argument proceeds similarly. Thus, the answer is \\(M^2\\) times the answer for the case \\(M = 1\\).\n\nThe fact that the expected number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\) can be shown by focusing on the depth of the vertex where he is on. By considering the depth, we essentially solve the problem: \u201cWhen performing a random walk on a path graph consisting of vertices \\(0, 1, \\dots, M\\) connected in this order, what is the expected number of steps needed to reach vertex \\(M\\) from vertex \\(0\\) and then return to vertex \\(0\\)?\u201d The answer to this problem is \\(2M^2\\).\n\nTherefore, we have solved this problem.

In this case, Takahashi alternates between moving to one of the leaf vertices and returning to vertex \\(0\\). We can consider the operation of going to a leaf and returning to the root as a single unit called a round trip. We consider the expected number of operations needed until all leaves are painted. When \\(i\\) leaves are already painted, the expected number of round trips needed until a new leaf is painted is \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\). Thus, the expected number of round trips until all leaves are painted is the sum of \\(\\frac{N}{N - i}\\) over \\(i = 0, 1, \\dots, N - 1\\). Each round trip requires \\(2\\) operations, and it is unnecessary to return to the root after all vertices are painted, so the answer is \\(\\left(\\frac{N}{N} + \\frac{N}{N - 1} + \\dots + \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{N}{1}\\right) \\times 2 - 1\\). Actually, we can handle a general \\(M\\) in the same way. Through some calculations, we find that the average number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\), and the rest of the argument proceeds similarly. Thus, the answer is \\(M^2\\) times the answer for the case \\(M = 1\\).\n\nThe fact that the expected number of operations per round trip is \\(2M^2\\) can be shown by focusing on the depth of the vertex where he is on. By considering the depth, we essentially solve the problem: \u201cWhen performing a random walk on a path graph consisting of vertices \\(0, 1, \\dots, M\\) connected in this order, what is the expected number of steps needed to reach vertex \\(M\\) from vertex \\(0\\) and then return to vertex \\(0\\)?\u201d The answer to this problem is \\(2M^2\\).\n\nTherefore, we have solved this problem.

For a contiguous segment of A or B, as long as its length does not become zero, we can reduce the length by 2 each time. For example, if there is a segment AAAAA, the possible final states are AAAAA, AAA, and A: there are three. Therefore, if the length of a segment of consecutive identical characters is L, the number of possible final states for that segment is floor((L+1)/2). For all segments of consecutive identical characters, the final states can be chosen independently.

The interval \\([L_i, R_i]\\) represents the range within which \\(A_i\\) can seemingly move. However, some positions within this range may be fixed, meaning \\(A_i\\) actually cannot move there. The set of intervals \\([L_i, R_i]\\) is laminar, forming a tree-like structure without partial overlaps.\n\nWe process in descending order of \\(A_i\\), which equates to ascending order of \\([L_i, R_i]\\) size. Within \\([L_i, R_i]\\), we calculate where \\(A_i\\) can actually move by excluding fixed positions. Suppose there are \\(k\\) intervals in the subtree of \\([L_i, R_i]\\): if \\(R_i - L_i + 1 = k\\), these intervals fill \\([L_i, R_i]\\), fixing those positions. Hence, \\(A_i\\) can move within \\([l, r]\\), excluding fixed positions.\n\nThe actual available positions depend on those not occupied by previously processed values. The count of such positions determines the candidates for placing the current \\(A_i\\). This must be done for all \\(A_i\\), considering duplicate values by dividing by an appropriate factor. \\(L_i\\) and \\(R_i\\) can be found using binary search and interval LCA queries on \\(B\\), processed in \\(O(\\log M + \\log N)\\) time. This leads to a time complexity of \\(O(N + M\\log M(\\log M + \\log N))\\), which can be optimized by handling interval min query and LCA query in \\(O(1)\\) time.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAn election is being held with \\( N \\) candidates numbered \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, N \\).

One can travel between any two cities by traversing some roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to \\( N \\), and the roads are numbered from 1 to \\( M \\). Road \\( i \\) connects cities \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) bidirectionally.\n\nDue to increasing traffic in the country, there is a plan to expand some roads. Currently, no roads have been expanded, and the cost to expand road \\( i \\) is \\( C_i \\).\n\nSince it is difficult to expand all roads at once, the plan is to first designate \\( K \\) out of the \\( N \\) cities as **major cities** and perform the minimum necessary expansion work, so that one can travel between any two major cities using only expanded roads. It has already been decided that cities \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, K-1 \\) will be major cities, but the last major city has not yet been decided.\n\nFor each \\( i = K, K+1, \\ldots, N \\), answer the following question: If city \\( i \\) is designated as the last major city, what is the minimum total cost of the expansion work required to ensure that one can travel between any two major cities using only expanded roads?\n\n**Constraints**\n\n- \\( 2 \\leq N \\leq 4000 \\)\n- \\( N-1 \\leq M \\leq 8000 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\leq K \\leq \\min(N, 10) \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq A_i < B_i \\leq N \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^9 \\)\n- One can travel between any two cities by traversing some roads.\n- All input values are integers.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n```\nN M K\nA_1 B_1 C_1\nA_2 B_2 C_2\n...\nA_M B_M C_M\n```\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint \\( N-K+1 \\) lines.

The left and right figures correspond to the cases \\( i=3 \\) and \\( i=4 \\), respectively. The colored circles represent the major cities, and the colored thick lines represent the roads that are expanded in an optimal solution. For \\( i=3 \\), expanding roads 4 and 5 results in a total cost of \\( 2+1=3 \\), which is the minimum. For \\( i=4 \\), expanding roads 1, 4, and 5 results in a total cost of \\( 3+2+1=6 \\), which is the minimum.\n\n**Sample Input 2**\n```\n4 3 2\n2 4 28\n1 4 56\n1 3 82\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2**\n```\n84\n82\n56\n```\n\n**Sample Input 3**\n```\n6 12 4\n2 6 68\n2 5 93\n4 6 28\n2 4 89\n3 6 31\n1 3 10\n1 2 53\n3 5 1\n3 5 74\n3 4 22\n4 5 80\n3 4 35\n```\n\n**Sample Output 3**\n```\n85\n64\n94\n```\n\nThere may be multiple roads connecting the same pair of cities.\n\nSolution:\n\nHere is the editorial with the C++ code translated to Python3:\n\n```\nJapan Registry Services (JPRS) Programming Contest 2024#2 (AtCoder Beginner Contest 364)\n\nOfficial\n\nG - Last Major City Editorial\n\nThis problem is an extension of the minimum Steiner tree problem. We referred to an editorial slide by Yoichi Iwata. A city, road, and cost are simply a vertex, edge, and weight. In an optimal solution, the graph defined by the set of edges to be extended as well as their adjacent vertices forms a tree. For a subset of the vertex set \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}\\) and vertex \\(v\\), \\(f(S,v)\\) is the minimum total weight of the edges of a tree containing vertex \\(v\\) and all vertices in \\(S\\). We seek \\(f(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}, v)\\) for each \\(K\\leq v\\leq N\\).\n\nThe function \\(f(S,v)\\) can be calculated with Dynamic Programming (DP), using initial values \\(f(\\{i\\}, i)=0\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq K-1)\\). There are two transitions: \n\n1. \\(f(S,v) \\leftarrow \\min(f(S,v),f(S,u) + w)\\) if an edge of weight \\(w\\) connects vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n2. \\(f(S,v) \\leftarrow \\min(f(S,v),f(T,v)+f(S\\setminus T,v))\\ (T\\subsetneq S, T\\neq \\emptyset)\\).\n\nThe transitions ensure efficient processing by filling the DP table in ascending order of the size of \\(S\\). The circular dependency in the former transition is managed by determining \\(f(S,v)\\) in ascending order of its value using Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. The overall complexity is \\(O(3^KN+2^KM\\log M)\\).\n\nSample code (Python3):\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef chmin(a, b):\n    return b < a\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2]) - 1\n    \n    G = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a = int(data[index]) - 1\n        b = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        G[a].append((b, c))\n        G[b].append((a, c))\n\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        dp[1 << i][i] = 0\n\n    for bit in range(1, 1 << k):\n        sub = bit\n        while sub > 0:\n            for i in range(n):\n                dp[bit][i] = min(dp[bit][i], dp[sub][i] + dp[bit - sub][i])\n            sub = (sub - 1) & bit\n\n        pq = [(dp[bit][i], i) for i in range(n)]\n        heapq.heapify(pq)\n\n        while pq:\n            d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            if d > dp[bit][u]:\n                continue\n            for v, l in G[u]:\n                if chmin(dp[bit][v], d + l):\n                    dp[bit][v] = d + l\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (d + l, v))\n\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        print(dp[-1][i])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc182_a", "abc364_g"]}, "abc327_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 200 points\n\nProblem Statement:  \nIn the \\( xy \\)-plane, there are three points \\( A(x_A, y_A) \\), \\( B(x_B, y_B) \\), and \\( C(x_C, y_C) \\) that are not collinear.

Starting from \\((h_1, w_1)\\), we combine \\((h_2, w_2)\\), and then continue to combine \\((h_3, w_3)\\). The condition is that if \\((h_2, w_2)\\) can be combined vertically/horizontally, then \\((h_3, w_3)\\) can also be combined similarly. For example, when \\(h_2 = h_3\\), if \\((h_2, w_2)\\) can be combined horizontally, then \\((h_3, w_3)\\) can also be combined horizontally. Similarly, when \\(w_2 = w_3\\), if \\((h_2, w_2)\\) can be combined vertically, then \\((h_3, w_3)\\) can also be combined vertically. \n\nCorrespondence to Graph and Counting: Let\u2019s count the number of pairs \\((l, r)\\) that satisfy the condition. When \\(l\\) is fixed, whether \\((l, r)\\) satisfies the condition is monotonic with respect to \\(r\\). For the orientation of the combination of two consecutive rectangles, we can determine whether the latter can be combined if the former can be combined. Represent this information in a graph with \\(2 \\times N\\) vertices.\n\nFor \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, N\\), let vertex \\(i\\) represent that \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined vertically, and vertex \\(N + i\\) represent that \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined horizontally. For \\(i = 2, 3, \\dots, N\\):\n\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined vertically, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can also be combined vertically, span an edge between vertices \\(i-1\\) and \\(i\\).\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined vertically, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined horizontally, span an edge between vertices \\(i-1\\) and \\(N + i\\).\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined horizontally, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined vertically, span an edge between vertices \\(N + i - 1\\) and \\(i\\).\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined horizontally, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined horizontally, span an edge between vertices \\(N + i - 1\\) and \\(N + i\\).\n\nAssume that \\((H_l, W_l)\\) can be combined both horizontally and vertically. Then, \\((l, r)\\) satisfies the condition if and only if either vertex \\(l\\) or \\(N + l\\) is connected to either vertex \\(r\\) or \\(N + r\\). Edges corresponding to combinations with different orientations will be spanned for at most one \\(l\\). Edges corresponding to combinations with the same orientation will be spanned for any \\(l\\) if they are initially spanned.\n\nRepresent the edges of the graph as a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix and load it on a segment tree. By performing binary search on the segment tree to find the maximum \\(r\\) that satisfies the condition, and updating the graph with segment tree updates, we process all \\(l\\) in \\(\\mathrm{O}(N \\log N)\\) time complexity.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a positive integer \\( N \\) and a sequence of \\( M \\) non-negative integers \\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_M) \\).\n\nHere, all elements of \\( A \\) are distinct integers between \\( 0 \\) and \\( N-1 \\), inclusive.\n\nFind the number, modulo \\( 998244353 \\), of permutations \\( P \\) of \\( (0, 1, \\dots, N-1) \\) that satisfy the following condition:\n\nAfter initializing a sequence \\( B = (B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_N) \\) to \\( P \\), it is possible to make \\( B = A \\) by repeating the following operation some number of times:\n- Choose \\( l \\) and \\( r \\) such that \\( 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq |B| \\), and if \\( \\mathrm{mex}(\\{B_l, B_{l+1}, \\dots, B_r\\}) \\) is contained in \\( B \\), remove it from \\( B \\).\n\n**What is \\( \\mathrm{mex}(X) \\)?**\n\nFor a finite set \\( X \\) of non-negative integers, \\( \\mathrm{mex}(X) \\) is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not in \\( X \\).\n\n**Constraints:**\n- \\( 1 \\leq M \\leq N \\leq 500 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\leq A_i < N \\)\n- All elements of \\( A \\) are distinct.\n- All input values are integers.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n```\nN M\nA_1 A_2 \\cdots A_M\n```\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint the answer.\n\n**Sample Input 1**\n\n```\n4 2\n1 3\n```\n\n**Sample Output 1**\n\n```\n8\n```\n\nAfter initializing \\( B = (2, 1, 0, 3) \\), it is possible to make \\( B = A \\) using the following steps:\n- Choose \\( (l, r) = (2, 4) \\), remove \\( \\mathrm{mex}(\\{1, 0, 3\\}) = 2 \\) from \\( B \\), making \\( B = (1, 0, 3) \\).\n- Choose \\( (l, r) = (3, 3) \\), remove \\( \\mathrm{mex}(\\{3\\}) = 0 \\) from \\( B \\), making \\( B = (1, 3) \\).\n\nThus, \\( P = (2, 1, 0, 3) \\) satisfies the condition.

He can combine these styles to swim by consuming stamina of \\(tA_1+(1-t)A_2\\) to advance \\(tB_1+(1-t)B_2\\) meters per second. This corresponds to points on the segment connecting \\((B_1,A_1)\\) and \\((B_2,A_2)\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\nIf there are \\(N\\) points \\((B_i,A_i)\\), he can swim for any point inside or on the convex hull's boundary, but not outside it. Plotting the styles on the \\(xy\\)-plane assists in this determination. The most time-efficient point has the maximum \\(B_i\\), and the most stamina-efficient point has the minimum \\(A_i/B_i\\). If he can't swim \\(D_i\\) meters using the stamina-efficient point, the answer is -1.\n\nTo swim \\(D_i\\) meters within stamina \\(C_i\\), locate the rightmost point in the intersection of the convex hull's circumference and a line passing through \\((0,0)\\) and \\((D_i,C_i)\\). This represents viable swimming styles under the stamina constraint. He should trace the convex hull from the stamina-efficient point to the time-efficient point counterclockwise. Using binary search helps identify which segment it lies on and then pinpoints \\(P_{opt}\\)'s exact coordinates.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc352_b", "abc356_g"]}, "abc328_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nAt the entrance of AtCoder Land, there is a single ticket booth where visitors line up to purchase tickets one by one.

First, if no operation can be performed on \\(B\\), the answer is No. Also, if there is a value in \\(B\\) that does not appear in \\(A\\), the answer is No. Actually, in all other cases, the answer is Yes. Let\u2019s reinterpret the part where \\(B_i\\) can be changed to any desired value as an operation where \\(B_i\\) is changed to a wildcard \\(*\\). By performing one operation on \\(B\\), we create a state where there is exactly one \\(*\\). The involvement of \\(*\\) enables us to swap adjacent elements in \\(B\\).\n\nIf you want to change \\(*x\\) to \\(x*\\): think of \\(*x\\) as \\(xx\\) and perform the operation to turn it into \\(x*\\). If you want to change \\(*xy\\) to \\(*yx\\): follow the steps \\(*xy \\to yxy \\to yx* \\to y*x \\to *yx\\).\n\nBy combining these operations, you can remove all duplicates in \\(B\\) and arrange them in any desired order. In particular, you can arrange \\(B\\) to match \\(A\\). Therefore, it can be determined that \\(A\\) can be transformed into \\(B\\). Implementing the above operations directly yields an \\(O(N)\\) solution. The sample code below lazily uses sorting and is an \\(O(N\\log N)\\) solution.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["arc179_a", "arc183_b"]}, "abc328_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 800 points\n\nProblem Statement: For positive integers \\(h\\) and \\(w\\), let \\((h, w)\\) denote a rectangle with height \\(h\\) and width \\(w\\).

Starting from \\((h_1, w_1)\\), we combine \\((h_2, w_2)\\), and then continue to combine \\((h_3, w_3)\\). The condition is that if \\((h_2, w_2)\\) can be combined vertically/horizontally, then \\((h_3, w_3)\\) can also be combined similarly. For example, when \\(h_2 = h_3\\), if \\((h_2, w_2)\\) can be combined horizontally, then \\((h_3, w_3)\\) can also be combined horizontally. Similarly, when \\(w_2 = w_3\\), if \\((h_2, w_2)\\) can be combined vertically, then \\((h_3, w_3)\\) can also be combined vertically. \n\nCorrespondence to Graph and Counting: Let\u2019s count the number of pairs \\((l, r)\\) that satisfy the condition. When \\(l\\) is fixed, whether \\((l, r)\\) satisfies the condition is monotonic with respect to \\(r\\). For the orientation of the combination of two consecutive rectangles, we can determine whether the latter can be combined if the former can be combined. Represent this information in a graph with \\(2 \\times N\\) vertices.\n\nFor \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, N\\), let vertex \\(i\\) represent that \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined vertically, and vertex \\(N + i\\) represent that \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined horizontally. For \\(i = 2, 3, \\dots, N\\):\n\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined vertically, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can also be combined vertically, span an edge between vertices \\(i-1\\) and \\(i\\).\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined vertically, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined horizontally, span an edge between vertices \\(i-1\\) and \\(N + i\\).\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined horizontally, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined vertically, span an edge between vertices \\(N + i - 1\\) and \\(i\\).\n- If \\((H_{i-1}, W_{i-1})\\) can be combined horizontally, and \\((H_i, W_i)\\) can be combined horizontally, span an edge between vertices \\(N + i - 1\\) and \\(N + i\\).\n\nAssume that \\((H_l, W_l)\\) can be combined both horizontally and vertically. Then, \\((l, r)\\) satisfies the condition if and only if either vertex \\(l\\) or \\(N + l\\) is connected to either vertex \\(r\\) or \\(N + r\\). Edges corresponding to combinations with different orientations will be spanned for at most one \\(l\\). Edges corresponding to combinations with the same orientation will be spanned for any \\(l\\) if they are initially spanned.\n\nRepresent the edges of the graph as a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix and load it on a segment tree. By performing binary search on the segment tree to find the maximum \\(r\\) that satisfies the condition, and updating the graph with segment tree updates, we process all \\(l\\) in \\(\\mathrm{O}(N \\log N)\\) time complexity.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given a permutation \\( P = (P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_N) \\) of \\((1, 2, \\dots, N)\\).\n\nConsider the following operations \\( k \\ (k = 2, 3, \\dots, N) \\) on this permutation.\n\n**Operation \\( k \\):** For \\( i = 1, 2, \\dots, k-1 \\) in this order, if \\( P_i > P_{i+1} \\), swap the values of the \\( i \\)-th and \\( (i+1) \\)-th elements of \\( P \\).\n\nYou are also given a **non-decreasing** sequence \\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_M) \\ (2 \\leq A_i \\leq N) \\) of length \\( M \\).\n\nFor each \\( i = 1, 2, \\dots, M \\), find the inversion number of \\( P \\) after applying the operations \\( A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i \\) in this order.\n\n*What is the inversion number of a sequence?*\n\nThe inversion number of a sequence \\( x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) \\) of length \\( n \\) is the number of pairs of integers \\( (i, j) \\ (1 \\leq i < j \\leq n) \\) such that \\( x_i > x_j \\).\n\n---\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- \\( 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq M \\leq 2 \\times 10^5 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\leq A_i \\leq N \\)\n- \\( P \\) is a permutation of \\( (1, 2, \\dots, N) \\).\n- \\( A_i \\leq A_{i+1} \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\dots, M-1 \\).\n- All input values are integers.\n\n---\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n```\nN\nP_1 P_2 \\dots P_N\nM\nA_1 A_2 \\dots A_M\n```\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint \\( M \\) lines.

We call those cells reachable to (-1,-1) \u201cinside,\u201d \nand unreachable \u201coutside.\u201d We first consider the case where the stones are connected in eight directions. \nBy enumerating eight cells around each cell beforehand, one can easily determine if these cells are inside or \noutside easily with BFS (Breadth First Search). The top-left cell is always outside; by performing BFS from this cell \nin four directions, one can reach all cells outside.\n\nExample: black cells represent lattice points with stones. Then, inspect each row. If there is a segment with \n\u201coutside stone inside \u2026 inside stone outside,\u201d then that segment can be counted as \u201cinside\u201d to count \u201cinside\u201d points. \nBeware of cases with consecutive stones, or stones between inside cells.\n\nNow we consider disconnected cases. It may seem we can consider each connected component independently, \nbut note that there may be a nested structure. After performing BFS for each connected component and determining whether \neach cell is outside or inside, when scanning the entire row, there may be parts like \n\u201coutside stone inside \u2026\u2026 outside stone inside \u2026\u2026 inside stone outside \u2026\u2026 inside stone outside,\u201d where some cells \ninside are labeled outside.\n\nEvery time you encounter \u201coutside, one or more stones, inside,\u201d the nest increases by one; for \n\u201cinside, one or more stones, outside,\u201d it decreases by one. By using this method to manage how many times the current \nposition is surrounded, one can handle this issue. Also, if there are different connected components sufficiently close \nto each other, the label (outside/inside) might be overwritten. This can be avoided by defining that stones are connected \nif the Chebyshev distance is two or less, instead of being eight-adjacent.\n'''\n```\n\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given a sequence \\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N) \\) of length \\( N \\) and an integer \\( K \\).

If \\(S_x + S_y\\) is odd, subtract \\(1\\) from \\(S_x\\). One can travel freely between the left and right halves, so traveling from the left half of one tile to another is a complete move. By paying a toll of \\(1\\), one can make either of these two moves:\n\n1. Move by \\(1\\) vertically and by \\(1\\) horizontally.\n2. Move by \\(2\\) horizontally.\n\nSuppose one could travel from \\((S_x, S_y)\\) to \\((T_x, T_y)\\) by making the first move \\(a\\) times and the second \\(b\\) times. The following conditions must hold:\n\n\\(\\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert \\leq a\\)\n\n\\(\\lvert S_x - T_x \\rvert \\leq a + 2b\\)\n\n\\(a > 0\\) or \\(S_x - T_x \\equiv 2b \\pmod{4}\\)\n\nConversely, if a pair of non-negative integers \\((a, b)\\) satisfies these conditions, then one can make the specified moves to travel from \\((S_x, S_y)\\) to \\((T_x, T_y)\\).\n\nWe aim to minimize the toll \\(a + b\\) while respecting \\((0 \\leq a, 0 \\leq b)\\) and the above conditions. With \\(0 \\leq b\\) and \\(\\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert \\leq a\\), it is necessary that \\(\\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert \\leq a + b\\). \n\nAdditionally, \\(\\frac{\\lvert S_x - T_x \\rvert + \\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert}{2} \\leq a + b\\).\n\nConversely, \\((a, b) = \\left( \\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert, \\max\\left\\lbrace 0, \\frac{\\lvert S_x - T_x \\rvert - \\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert}{2} \\right\\rbrace \\right)\\) always satisfies all the conditions, thus ensuring one or both equations hold as an equality.\n\nHence, the minimum toll is:\n\n\\[\\max\\left\\lbrace \\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert, \\frac{\\lvert S_x - T_x \\rvert + \\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert}{2} \\right\\rbrace = \\frac{\\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert + \\max \\lbrace \\lvert S_x - T_x \\rvert, \\lvert S_y - T_y \\rvert \\rbrace}{2}\\].\n\nBelow is the sample code:\n\n```python\nSx, Sy = map(int, input().split())\nTx, Ty = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (Sx + Sy) % 2 == 1:\n    Sx -= 1\nif (Tx + Ty) % 2 == 1:\n    Tx -= 1\n\nDx = abs(Sx - Tx)\nDy = abs(Sy - Ty)\n\nprint((Dy + max(Dx, Dy)) // 2)\n```\n\n---\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given a tree with \\( N \\) vertices numbered \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, N \\).

We will perform operation 1 as needed and consider the following operations:\n\nOperation A: When the piece and the gate are on the same vertex, move both the piece and the gate to an adjacent vertex. Operation B: Move the piece to an adjacent vertex. Operation C: Move the piece to the vertex where the gate is located.\n\nOperations A and B each incur a cost of 1. Once operation B is performed, the gate remains in its position until operation C is performed. It's inefficient to move the piece to the gate using operation B, so we will not consider this.\n\nLet \\(v\\) be the initial position of the piece and gate. By performing operation C at the end, the process ends when the piece and the gate are on the same vertex. Label the vertices and edges the gate moves to with A, and the rest with B. The vertices and edges labeled A form a connected subgraph, or subtree A. Vertex \\(v\\) is included in subtree A. Edges labeled B with one endpoint as A are boundary edges.\n\nVertices and edges labeled B not connected to boundary edges form connected components. Each component is a tree connected to a vertex in subtree A by a boundary edge \\(e_i\\). Let them form subtree \\(B_i\\), connected to vertex \\(l_i\\) in A.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. In optimal operations, assume edges labeled A are not traversed by operation B. By rearranging operations, the cost does not increase:\n\n   - The piece and gate start from \\(v\\), visit all vertices in A using operation A, and return to \\(v\\). This is the journey in A.\n   - If \\(l_i\\) is visited during A's journey, it's interrupted. The piece starts from \\(l_i\\), visits all vertices in \\(B_i\\) using operation B, and returns to \\(l_i\\). This is the journey in \\(B_i\\). The gate stays at \\(l_i\\).\n\n2. Assume moving along boundary edge \\(e_i\\) occurs only once in B's journey. If done more than once, moving with the gate using operation A during the first move and returning does not increase the cost. In \\(B_i\\)'s journey, operation C is done once at the end.\n\n3. In the journeys of A and \\(B_i\\), the farthest vertex is visited last. If the distance from start to the farthest vertex is \\(d\\) and the number of edges is \\(m\\), the cost is \\(2m - d\\).\n\nThe total number of edges in subtrees is \\(N-1\\). Minimize cost by maximizing \\(d\\)'s total sum. Calculate for fixed \\(v\\) using tree DP. Maintain:\n\n- Maximum distance to vertex where \\(B_i\\)'s journey ends, assuming \\(u = l_i\\).\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex not in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n\nExtend to rerooting DP to examine all possible starting vertices.

Once a sock is drawn, it will not be returned to the chest.\n\nFind the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the number of times he has to draw a sock from the chest.\n\nIt can be proved that the sought expected value is always rational.

There remains one sock each of colors 1 and 2 in the chest.\n3. Draw a sock of color 1 from the chest. The socks drawn so far are two of color 1 and one of color 2, allowing a pair of color 1 socks to be made, thus ending the operation.\n\nIn this example, Takahashi draws a sock from the chest three times. The expected number of times Takahashi draws a sock from the chest is 3 with probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) and 2 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), so the expected value is \\( 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} \\equiv 665496238 \\pmod{998244353} \\).\n\n**Sample Input 2:**\n```\n1\n352\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2:**\n```\n2\n```\n\n**Sample Input 3:**\n```\n6\n1796 905 2768 253 2713 1448\n```\n\n**Sample Output 3:**\n```\n887165507\n```\n\nSolution:\n\n        Here is the cleaned version of the editorial content without extraneous information:\n\n---\n\nLet \\(S = A_1 + A_2 + \\dots + A_N\\). By the Pigeonhole Theorem, Takahashi draws a sock at most \\(N+1\\) times. Let \\(P_i\\) be the probability that he draws a sock at least \\(i\\) times. The expected value is \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\nLet \\(Q_i\\) be the probability that he draws a sock exactly \\(i\\) times. The expected value is \\(1 \\cdot Q_1 + 2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\dots + (N+1) \\cdot Q_{N+1}\\). Using \\(Q_i = P_i - P_{i+1}\\), this can be rewritten as \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\n\\(P_{i+1}\\) is equivalent to the probability that there is no duplicating color after drawing \\(i\\) socks. Denote \\(f_i\\) as the number of ways to choose \\(i\\) socks with different colors among the \\(S\\) socks: \\(P_{i+1} = \\frac{f_i}{\\binom{S}{i}}\\). Finding \\(\\binom{S}{0}, \\binom{S}{1}, \\dots, \\binom{S}{N}\\) is trivial, so the task is to find \\(f_i\\).\n\nDefine a polynomial \\(F = \\sum_{i=0}^{S} f_i x^i\\). Since \\(f_i = \\sum_{1 \\leq k_1 < k_2 < \\dots < k_i \\leq N} \\prod_{l=1}^{i} A_{k_l}\\), \\(F\\) is the total product of \\(F_1, F_2, \\dots, F_N\\), where \\(F_i = (1 + A_i x)\\).

Use Dynamic Programming (DP) with `dp[i][j]` representing the length of a LIS chosen from the first \\( i \\) elements with the last element \\( j \\). Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and `dp[0][1] = dp[0][2] = ... = dp[0][N] = -float('inf')`. The transitions for \\( i = 1, 2, ..., N \\) are:\n\n1. `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][k] + 1 for k in range(j))` for `j = A[i]`.\n2. `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]` for `j != A[i]`.\n\nThe length of a LIS is `max(dp[N][k] for k in range(N + 1))`. It is possible to reconstruct a LIS. The complexity can be reduced to \\(O(N \\log N)\\) using a segment tree.\n\nThe DP can be efficiently implemented using pseudocode and a segment tree for segment-max retrieval, which allows LIS length to be obtained in \\(O(N \\log N)\\). Furthermore, by considering constrained LIS lengths `l_i` and `r_i`, and checking if `l_i + r_i - 1 = L`, where `L` is the LIS length, we can address this problem. `l` is found by memorizing DP results, and `r` by reversing the array and applying the same algorithm.\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThere are \\(N - 1\\) white balls and one black ball.

Define\n\n\\(\\mathrm{dp}[i] :=\\) Probability that \\(i\\) operations make the leftmost ball black.\n\nWhat we want is \\(\\mathrm{dp}[K]\\). The transition requires the following two probabilities:\n\n- The probability that an operation moves the leftmost black ball to somewhere else.\n- The probability that an operation moves the black ball elsewhere to the leftmost position.\n\nDenoting them by \\(p, q\\), the transitions are as follows:\n\n\\(\\mathrm{dp}[0] = 1\\)  \n\\(\\mathrm{dp}[i+1] = (1 - p) \\mathrm{dp}[i] + q(1 - \\mathrm{dp}[i])\\)\n\nBy simple combinatorics:\n\n\\(\\displaystyle p = \\frac{2(n - 1)}{n^2}\\)  \n\\(\\displaystyle q = \\frac{2}{n^2}\\)\n\nImplementing it naively yields an \\(\\mathcal{O}(K)\\) solution, but it simplifies to a first-order recurrence relation, which can be efficiently computed, allowing \\(\\mathrm{dp}[K]\\) to be found in \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log K)\\) time.

With this feature, implementation will be simple. For example in Python, the < operator compares strings in lexicographical order. The total rating \\(T\\) of the users can be found using a for loop. Then one can find \\(T \\bmod N\\) to find the index of the winner. Also, one has to find the number assigned to each user. This can be done by sorting the user\u2019s name in lexicographical order. Most languages provide a sorting function, which enables us concise implementation.\n\nThe complexity of sorting strings:\nLet \\(\\displaystyle M = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |S_i| \\). With merge sort, the complexity is \\(O(M \\log N)\\). This is due to the fact that lexicographical comparison of two strings \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be done in \\(O(\\min(|a|, |b|))\\) time.

If a good spanning tree exists, when we define the cost of an edge \\( (u,v) \\) as \\(|X_u - X_v|\\) using a strictly increasing sequence \\(X\\), the good spanning tree will be one of the minimum spanning trees. This follows from Kruskal's algorithm and the fact that for an edge \\( (u,v) \\) not included in the good spanning tree, the cost of the edges on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) will be less than \\(|X_u - X_v|\\). Specifically, if we consider setting \\(X_u = 10^u\\) or \\(-10^{N-u}\\), the costs of each edge will be distinct, so the minimum spanning tree will be uniquely determined. The good spanning tree will be equal to both of the following:\n\n1. The minimum spanning tree \\(T_1\\) when the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\) is \\((N+1)v - u\\)\n2. The minimum spanning tree \\(T_2\\) when the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\) is \\((N+1)(N+1-u) - (N+1-v)\\)\n\nTherefore, for a good spanning tree to exist, it is necessary that \\(T_1 = T_2\\). Conversely, in \\(T_1\\), for an edge \\((u,v)\\), the maximum vertex number on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be \\(v\\). In \\(T_2\\), for an edge \\((u,v)\\), the minimum vertex number on the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must be \\(u\\). Thus, the above conditions are also sufficient. From the above, the existence of a good spanning tree can be determined by finding \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) and checking if they are identical. Then, to determine the existence of a good spanning tree when each edge is removed, we can find the changes in the minimum spanning tree when the edge is removed and check for identicalness.\n\nFor the minimum spanning tree \\(T\\) of graph \\(G\\), the minimum spanning tree \\(T_{u,v}\\) of the graph obtained by removing edge \\((u,v)\\) can be obtained by the following steps:\n- If \\((u,v)\\) is not included in \\(T\\), then \\(T_{u,v} = T\\).\n- Otherwise, remove \\((u,v)\\) from \\(T\\). As a result, \\(T\\) will be divided into two connected components. Among the edges that span the two connected components, add the one with the minimum cost to \\(T\\) to obtain the tree \\(T_{u,v}\\).\n\nTherefore, we need to solve the following problem:\n\n1. For each edge \\(e\\) in the minimum spanning tree \\(T\\) of graph \\(G\\), initialize a variable \\(X_e\\) to \\(\\infty\\).\n2. For each edge \\((u,v)\\) in graph \\(G\\) that is not included in \\(T\\), update \\(X_e \\leftarrow \\min(X_e, C_{u,v})\\) (where \\(C_{u,v}\\) is the cost of edge \\((u,v)\\)) for each edge \\(e\\) included in the simple path connecting \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in \\(T\\), and find the final values of \\(X_e\\).\n\nThis can be processed in \\(O(M \\log N)\\) time by handling range chmin queries with a segment tree while performing a DFS. Alternatively, by decomposing the tree into heavy and light paths and arranging the heavy paths, it can be converted into \\(O(\\log N)\\) range chmin queries, allowing it to be processed in \\(O(M \\log^2 N)\\) time, which is also sufficient.\n```\n\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given \\( N \\) intervals of real numbers.

Use Dynamic Programming (DP) with `dp[i][j]` representing the length of a LIS chosen from the first \\( i \\) elements with the last element \\( j \\). Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and `dp[0][1] = dp[0][2] = ... = dp[0][N] = -float('inf')`. The transitions for \\( i = 1, 2, ..., N \\) are:\n\n1. `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][k] + 1 for k in range(j))` for `j = A[i]`.\n2. `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]` for `j != A[i]`.\n\nThe length of a LIS is `max(dp[N][k] for k in range(N + 1))`. It is possible to reconstruct a LIS. The complexity can be reduced to \\(O(N \\log N)\\) using a segment tree.\n\nThe DP can be efficiently implemented using pseudocode and a segment tree for segment-max retrieval, which allows LIS length to be obtained in \\(O(N \\log N)\\). Furthermore, by considering constrained LIS lengths `l_i` and `r_i`, and checking if `l_i + r_i - 1 = L`, where `L` is the LIS length, we can address this problem. `l` is found by memorizing DP results, and `r` by reversing the array and applying the same algorithm.\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc368_a", "abc354_f"]}, "abc333_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given positive integers \\(N\\) and \\(K\\).\n\nAn integer sequence of length \\(N\\) where all elements are between \\(1\\) and \\(2^K - 1\\), inclusive, is called a **good sequence**.\n\nThe **score** of a good sequence \\(A = (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N)\\) is defined as follows:\n- The number of distinct integers that can be expressed as \\(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) using an integer \\(i\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(N\\), inclusive, and a non-negative integer \\(k\\).\n\nFor example, for \\(A = (3, 5)\\), five integers can be expressed as \\(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\): \\(0, 1, 2, 3,\\) and \\(5\\), so the score is \\(5\\).\n\nFind one good sequence with the maximum score.\n\nFor each input file, you are given \\(T\\) test cases to solve.\n\n### Constraints\n- \\(1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq K \\leq 30\\)\n- The sum of \\(N\\) across the test cases in a single input file is at most \\(2 \\times 10^5\\).\n- All input values are integers.\n\n### Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format.

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem. The time complexity is \\(O(NK)\\) due to the bit-reversal calculation being the bottleneck.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n\n    def bit_reversal(x):\n        return int(bin(x)[2:].zfill(K - 1)[::-1], 2)\n\n    if N >= 2 ** (K - 1):\n        print(*[max(1, 2**K - i - 1) for i in range(N)])\n    else:\n        print(*[2 ** (K - 1) + bit_reversal(i) for i in range(N)])\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also solve it by constructing from the highest bit downwards.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    C = [1]\n    for _ in range(1, K):\n        D = [2 * c for c in C] + [2 * c + 1 for c in C]\n        C = D[:N]\n    while len(C) < N:\n        C.append(1)\n    print(*C)\n```\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Score:** 475 points\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nIn the nation of Atcoder, there are \\( N \\) cities numbered from 1 to \\( N \\), and \\( M \\) trains numbered from 1 to \\( M \\).

Conversely, if neither \\(1\\) nor \\(N\\) is included in \\(A\\), a good permutation does exist. Let\u2019s consider this case. For example, if we set \\(P = (1, N, N - 1, N - 2, \\dots, 3, 2)\\), the only contiguous subsequence of \\(P\\) that includes both \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) is \\(P\\) itself, making \\(P\\) a good permutation. \n\nSince a good permutation with \\(P_{1} = 1\\) exists, the lexicographically smallest good permutation will have \\(P_{1} = 1\\). For any integer \\(x\\), if there exists a contiguous subsequence of \\(P\\) that is a permutation of \\((1, 2, \\dots, x)\\), it must be \\((P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{x})\\).

In this editorial, we introduce an approach that formalizes the problem as a cost-flow problem.\n\nThe problem involves preprocessing using segment-tree divide-and-conquer. For offline queries, you can simplify them using segment-tree divide-and-conquer. Queries consist of inserting tasks into a set and removing the last task inserted. Segment-tree divide-and-conquer helps manage these queries efficiently by converting removal queries to undo queries, maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nA segment tree is prepared to manage the timeline of queries. Each node of the segment tree stores a vector that manages elements. After preprocessing, elements are inserted into the segment tree nodes, and a DFS is performed to process these nodes. The complexity is \\(\\mathrm{O}(Q \\log T f(n))\\), with \\(Q\\) as the number of queries, \\(T\\) as the maximum time, and \\(\\mathrm{O}(f(n))\\) as the complexity of insertion and undo queries.\n\nFormalizing the problem as a cost-flow problem, insertions are represented as cost-flow in a graph. The problem is simplified to one kind of query: inserting a new task and printing the answer to the subproblem. If a negative cycle exists when an edge is added, remove the negative cycle with the smallest cost to maintain optimal flow in the graph.\n\nThis cost-flow problem can be rephrased using operations on task sets, representing graph flows with task insertions. Tasks inserted into the set \\(X\\) can potentially fulfill the deadlines. Operations for updating task sets are derived from negative cycle removal in the cost-flow graph.\n\nUsing Hall\u2019s marriage theorem and segment trees, a data structure is constructed to manage task sets efficiently, supporting task insertion and validity checks. The problem solution operates within \\(\\mathrm{O}((N + Q) \\log Q \\log N)\\) time, which is efficient.\n\nBonus: There\u2019s an alternative \\(\\mathrm{O}((N + Q) \\log N)\\) solution the author holds but hasn\u2019t fully proven, left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n---\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc370_d", "abc363_g"]}, "abc334_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe Kingdom of AtCoder has \\( N \\) towns numbered from 1 to \\( N \\).

The following is a visualization of Sample Input/Output 1. For cards \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we have \\(A_x > A_y\\) and \\(C_x < C_y\\) if and only if the point corresponding to card \\(x\\) is in the lower-right region of that for card \\(y\\). In Sample Input/Output 1, card \\(3\\) is in the lower-right region of card \\(1\\).\n\nConsider the condition of a card that is never discarded. By the discussion above, a card is never removed if there is no point on the lower-right region of the point for itself. Otherwise, the card is always removed. The set of cards that has no point on its lower-right region can be found as follows. Scan the cards in ascending order of their costs, i.e., from lower points to higher, and include those that update the maximum strength so far (the rightmost one) to the answer. (Not being able to update the maximum strength means there is a card with smaller cost and larger strength, i.e., there is a card on its lower-right region.)\n\nSort cards in ascending order of \\(C_i\\). First, let \\(v = 0\\), and let \\(S\\) be an empty set. For \\(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N\\) in order, if \\(A_i > v\\), then insert the \\(i\\)-th card, and set \\(v\\) to \\(A_i\\).

The number of connected components in the undirected graph corresponds to the number of cycles in the directed graph, so we will focus on the latter.\n\n1. **When \\(\\gcd(N, A) \\neq 1\\):**\n\n   Let \\(f^N(x)\\) represent the vertex reached after \\(N\\) moves starting from vertex \\(x\\). We have \\(\\displaystyle f^N(x)\\equiv A^N x + B\\frac{A^N-1}{A-1}\\ \\text{mod}\\ N\\). Here, let \\(d = \\gcd(N, A^N)\\). Since \\(\\displaystyle f^N(x+1)-f^N(x)\\equiv A^N\\equiv 0\\ \\text{mod}\\ d\\), the vertices forming a cycle all match \\(f^N(0)\\) modulo \\(d\\). Considering only these vertices, the problem can be reduced to the case where \\(\\displaystyle(N, A, B) \\leftarrow \\left(\\frac{N}{d}, A \\mod \\frac{N}{d}, \\frac{A^N}{d}B \\mod \\frac{N}{d}\\right)\\). By performing this substitution, the problem can be reduced to the case where \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\).\n\n2. **When \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\):**\n\n   If \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\), all vertices form some cycle. Therefore, the answer is the sum of the reciprocals of the lengths of the cycles formed by each vertex. If vertex \\(x\\) returns to its original position after \\(K\\) moves, then \\(\\displaystyle A^K x + B\\frac{A^K-1}{A-1}\\equiv x\\ \\text{mod}\\ N\\), which implies \\(\\displaystyle A^K\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ \\frac{N(A-1)}{\\gcd(N(A-1), (A-1)x+B)}\\). Letting \\(G = \\gcd(A-1, B)\\), \\(A'=\\frac{A-1}{G}\\), \\(B'=\\frac{B}{G}\\), and \\(N'=\\frac{N}{\\gcd(A'^N, N)}\\), we have \\(\\displaystyle \\gcd(N(A-1), (A-1)x+B)=G\\gcd(N', A'x+B')\\). Since \\(A'\\) and \\(N'\\) are coprime, for each \\(0\\le y<N'\\), there exist exactly \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\) values \\(0\\le x<N\\) such that \\(y\\equiv A'x+B'\\ \\text{mod}\\ N'\\). Therefore, if we let \\(C_y\\) be the smallest positive integer \\(K\\) such that \\(\\displaystyle A^K\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ \\frac{NA'}{\\gcd(y, N')}\\) for each \\(0\\le y<N'\\), the desired answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\sum_{y=0}^{N'-1}\\frac{1}{C_y}\\). Values of \\(y\\) with the same \\(\\gcd(y, N')\\) have the same \\(C_y\\). Therefore, for each divisor \\(n\\) of \\(N'\\), we need to find the answer for \\(n = \\gcd(y, N')\\), and sum them up. The number of values \\(0\\le y<N'\\) such that \\(n = \\gcd(y, N')\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\left(\\frac{N'}{n}\\right)\\), so the answer can be expressed as \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\sum_{n| N'}\\frac{1}{C_n}\\phi\\left(\\frac{N'}{n}\\right)\\). Here, \\(\\phi\\) is the Euler\u2019s totient function.\n\nTo compute \\(C_n\\) for each \\(n\\), we can use the following facts:\n\n- By Euler\u2019s theorem, the candidates for \\(C_1\\) are divisors of \\(\\phi(NA')\\).\n- Let \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) be divisors of \\(N'\\). If \\(n_1\\) divides \\(n_2\\), then \\(C_{n_2}\\) divides \\(C_{n_1}\\).\n\nThis approach can be implemented using a DFS-like method. The value of \\(\\phi(NA')\\) and its prime factorization can be computed quickly by precomputing the prime factorizations of all positive integers up to \\(N\\).\n\n---\n\nThis concise editorial provides a clear breakdown of the problem-solving approach without unnecessary content.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc363_c", "arc182_f"]}, "abc335_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nYou are given a sequence \\( A = (A_1, \\ldots, A_N) \\) of length \\( N \\).

If \\(K\\geq N\\) and parities are the same, a solution can always be constructed. Starting from the path of the shortest length \\(N\\), increase the length by \\(2\\) incrementally, as \\(N, N+2, N+4, \\dots\\).\n\nImplement carefully with some casework. Use casework and construction separately. The sample code outlines how to compute the sequence of squares, build walls, and remove those between adjacent squares.\n\nSample code (Python 3):\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n    if k < n or k % 2 != n % 2:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    print(\"Yes\")\n    path = []\n    k -= n\n    i = 0\n    while i < n - 1:\n        if i != n - 3:\n            w = 1 + min(m - 1, k // 2)\n            k -= (w - 1) * 2\n            for j in range(w):\n                path.append((i, m - 1 - j))\n            for j in range(w):\n                path.append((i + 1, m - w + j))\n        elif k <= (m - 1) * 2:\n            w = 1 + k // 2\n            for j in range(w):\n                path.append((i, m - 1 - j))\n            for j in range(w):\n                path.append((i + 1, m - w + j))\n            path.append((i + 2, m - 1))\n        else:\n            for j in range(m):\n                path.append((i, m - 1 - j))\n            k -= (m - 1) * 2\n            j = 0\n            while j < m:\n                if k:\n                    path.append((i + 1, j))\n                    path.append((i + 2, j))\n                    path.append((i + 2, j + 1))\n                    path.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    j += 2\n                    k -= 2\n                else:\n                    path.append((i + 1, j))\n                    j += 1\n            path.append((i + 2, m - 1))\n        i += 2\n    \n    c = [['|' for _ in range(m - 1)] for _ in range(n)]\n    r = [['-' for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n - 1)]\n    for i in range(len(path) - 1):\n        x1, y1 = path[i]\n        x2, y2 = path[i + 1]\n        if x1 == x2:\n            c[x1][min(y1, y2)] = '.'\n        else:\n            r[min(x1, x2)][y1] = '.'\n    \n    print('+' + 'S'.join([''] + ['-' * (2 * m - 1), '+']))\n    for i in range(n):\n        print('+', end='')\n        for j in range(m - 1):\n            print('o' + c[i][j], end='')\n        print(\"o+\")\n        if i < n - 1:\n            for j in range(m):\n                print('+' + r[i][j], end='')\n            print('+')\n    print('+' + 'G'.join([''] + ['-' * (2 * m - 1), '+']))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nFind the number of permutations \\( P = (P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N) \\) of \\( (1, 2, \\ldots, N) \\) that satisfy all of the following \\( M \\) conditions, modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\nThe \\( i \\)-th condition: The maximum among \\( P_{L_i}, P_{L_i+1}, \\ldots, P_{R_i} \\) is **not** \\( P_{X_i} \\).

Let \\(dp[l][r]\\) denote the answer when considering only the interval \\([l,r]\\). We assume that when considering the interval \\([l,r]\\), only the intervals \\([L_i,R_i]\\) that satisfy \\(l \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq r\\) are given as conditions. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the values of \\(P_l,\\cdots,P_r\\) range from \\(1\\) to \\(r-l+1\\). Let\u2019s consider how to calculate \\(dp[l][r]\\).\n\nWe will do a case-by-case analysis based on the position \\(m\\) of the maximum value of \\(P_l,\\cdots,P_r\\). If there is a condition with \\(X_i=m\\), then that \\(m\\) is invalid. Consider the case without one. First, the conditions that satisfy \\(L_i \\leq m \\leq R_i\\) can be ignored from this point onward. This reduces the problem to calculating \\(dp[l][m-1]\\) and \\(dp[m+1][r]\\). Thus, we obtain the transition for \\(dp\\).\n\nNote that, since there is flexibility in the allocation of value sets to the left and right sides, it is necessary to multiply by the binomial coefficient corresponding to this. This gives us an \\(O(N^3)\\) DP solution.\n\nHere, it is necessary to enumerate the prohibited \\(m\\) for each \\([l,r]\\), but checking the \\(M\\) conditions each time would take \\(O(N^2 M)\\) time, which is too slow. By fixing \\(l\\) and managing the positions of prohibited \\(m\\) while increasing \\(r\\), it takes \\(O(NM)\\) time in total, which is fast enough. The overall time complexity is \\(O(N^3+NM)\\).\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc358_f", "arc183_c"]}, "abc336_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 100 points\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nTakahashi is planning to eat \\( N \\) dishes. \n- The \\( i \\)-th dish he plans to eat is sweet if \\( S_i = \\text{sweet} \\), and salty if \\( S_i = \\text{salty} \\). \n- If he eats two sweet dishes consecutively, he will feel sick and be unable to eat any more dishes. \n\nDetermine whether he can eat all the dishes.\n\n**Constraints**\n- \\( N \\) is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n- Each \\( S_i \\) is either \\text{sweet} or \\text{salty}.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is provided in the following format:\n\n```\nN\nS_1\nS_2\n...\nS_N\n```\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint `Yes` if Takahashi can eat all the dishes, and `No` otherwise.\n\n**Sample Input 1**\n```\n5\nsalty\nsweet\nsalty\nsalty\nsweet\n```\n\n**Sample Output 1**\n```\nYes\n```\n*Takahashi will not eat two sweet dishes consecutively, so he can eat all the dishes without feeling sick.*\n\n**Sample Input 2**\n```\n4\nsweet\nsalty\nsweet\nsweet\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2**\n```\nYes\n```\n*He will feel sick but can still eat all the dishes.*\n\n**Sample Input 3**\n```\n6\nsalty\nsweet\nsweet\nsalty\nsweet\nsweet\n```\n\n**Sample Output 3**\n```\nNo\n```\n*He feels sick when eating the 3rd dish and cannot eat the 4th and subsequent dishes.*\n\nSolution:\n\n        [BEGIN TEXT]\n        Japan Registry Services (JPRS) Programming Contest 2024#2 (AtCoder Beginner Contest 364)\n\nIf there exists an integer \\(i\\) between \\(1\\) and \\((N-2)\\) such that the \\(i\\)-th and \\((i+1)\\)-th dishes to eat are both sweet, he cannot eat the \\((i+2)\\)-th dish and cannot eat all of the dishes.

In this editorial, we introduce an approach that formalizes the problem as a cost-flow problem.\n\nThe problem involves preprocessing using segment-tree divide-and-conquer. For offline queries, you can simplify them using segment-tree divide-and-conquer. Queries consist of inserting tasks into a set and removing the last task inserted. Segment-tree divide-and-conquer helps manage these queries efficiently by converting removal queries to undo queries, maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nA segment tree is prepared to manage the timeline of queries. Each node of the segment tree stores a vector that manages elements. After preprocessing, elements are inserted into the segment tree nodes, and a DFS is performed to process these nodes. The complexity is \\(\\mathrm{O}(Q \\log T f(n))\\), with \\(Q\\) as the number of queries, \\(T\\) as the maximum time, and \\(\\mathrm{O}(f(n))\\) as the complexity of insertion and undo queries.\n\nFormalizing the problem as a cost-flow problem, insertions are represented as cost-flow in a graph. The problem is simplified to one kind of query: inserting a new task and printing the answer to the subproblem. If a negative cycle exists when an edge is added, remove the negative cycle with the smallest cost to maintain optimal flow in the graph.\n\nThis cost-flow problem can be rephrased using operations on task sets, representing graph flows with task insertions. Tasks inserted into the set \\(X\\) can potentially fulfill the deadlines. Operations for updating task sets are derived from negative cycle removal in the cost-flow graph.\n\nUsing Hall\u2019s marriage theorem and segment trees, a data structure is constructed to manage task sets efficiently, supporting task insertion and validity checks. The problem solution operates within \\(\\mathrm{O}((N + Q) \\log Q \\log N)\\) time, which is efficient.\n\nBonus: There\u2019s an alternative \\(\\mathrm{O}((N + Q) \\log N)\\) solution the author holds but hasn\u2019t fully proven, left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n---\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 650 points\n\nProblem Statement:\nThere is a special grid with \\( N \\) rows.

Solve the problem against \\(B\\) for each \\(j\\), and the total sum of the answers multiplied by \\(2^j\\) is the solution to the original problem. This simplifies the problem as \\(B\\) takes only zero or one, as opposed to \\(A\\) taking variable values.\n\nNext, the expression \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (B_i \\oplus B_{i+1}\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus B_j)\\) requires the total XOR of a segment. This can be computed fast using cumulative XORs, similar to cumulative sums when computing the total sum on a segment. Define the array of cumulative XORs \\(C\\) by \\(C_0=0\\) and \\(C_i =B_1\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus B_i\\). Then \\(B_i \\oplus B_{i+1}\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus B_j = C_{i-1} \\oplus C_j\\).\n\nThe expression can be rewritten as follows:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i-1} \\oplus C_j)  = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2}\\sum_{j=i+2}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j). \\]\n\nAdjusting the index \\(j\\) to start from \\(i+1\\):\n\\[ \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2}\\sum_{j=i+2}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j) - \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (C_i\\oplus C_{i+1}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} B_i. \\]\n\nNow \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^N (C_{i} \\oplus C_j)\\) is the number of pairs of elements in \\(C\\) with different values, which equals the product of the number of occurrences of \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) in \\(C\\).

Then, the two available operations become:\n\nAAA \u2192 A  \nBBB \u2192 B  \n\nWith this transformation, the solution becomes straightforward. For a contiguous segment of A or B, as long as its length does not become zero, we can reduce the length by 2 each time. For example, if there is a segment AAAAA, the possible final states are AAAAA, AAA, and A: there are three. Therefore, if the length of a segment of consecutive identical characters is L, the number of possible final states for that segment is floor((L+1)/2). For all segments of consecutive identical characters, the final states can be chosen independently. Thus, the product of the above values for all such segments is the answer to this problem.\n```\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 1100 points\n\nProblem Statement:\nYou have an integer sequence \\(a=(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N)\\) of length \\(N\\).

Then, if \\( k \\leq N - 1 \\), sort the elements from the \\((k+1)\\)-th to the \\( N \\)-th position of \\( P \\) in ascending order.\n\nIt can be proved that under the constraints of this problem, it is possible to transform any given permutation \\( P \\) into the identity permutation with a finite number of operations.

In fact:\n\n1. Perform the operation with \\(k=1\\). This sorts the entire array if \\(P_1=1\\) in the initial state. Otherwise, we have \\(P_N \\neq 1\\) after the operation since \\(N \\geq 3\\).\n2. Next, perform the operation with \\(k=N\\). Since \\(P_N \\neq 1\\) before the operation, we have \\(P_1=1\\) after the operation.\n3. Perform the operation with \\(k=1\\). Since \\(P_1=1\\) before the operation, the entire array is certainly sorted after the operation.\n\nBy performing the above, any permutation can be sorted in at most three operations. Therefore, it is sufficient to quickly determine if the array can be sorted in zero, one, or two operations.\n\n- The determination for zero operations is trivial.\n- For one operation, if we fix \\(k\\), it is necessary and sufficient that the minimum and maximum values of \\((P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{k-1})\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(k-1\\), respectively, and \\(P_k=k\\). This can be checked in \\(O(1)\\) time for each \\(k\\) by taking cumulative \\(\\min\\) and \\(\\max\\), so the overall determination can be done in \\(O(N)\\) time.\n- For two operations, if \\(P_N \\neq 1\\), starting from the second of the three operations, the array can be sorted in two operations. Similarly, if \\(P_1 \\neq N\\), it can be sorted in two operations. Conversely, if \\(P_1=N\\) and \\(P_N=1\\), the relative positions of \\(1\\) and \\(N\\) in \\(P\\) do not change with one operation, leaving them in the order \\(N, 1\\). Therefore, \\(P\\) can be sorted in two or fewer operations \\(\\iff\\) \\(P_1 \\neq N\\) or \\(P_N \\neq 1\\). This can be checked in \\(O(1)\\) time.\n\nFrom the above, the answer for each test case can be found in \\(O(N)\\) time.\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc357_c", "arc181_a"]}, "abc339_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 550 points\n\nProblem Statement:\nYou are given a sequence of integers \\( A = (A_1, \\ldots, A_N) \\).

If all elements of \\(B\\) are positive, subtracting \\(1\\) from all elements can reduce \\(\\max(B)\\) without changing the sum of abs. When \\(B\\) is sorted in ascending order, the sum of abs can be expressed as follows: \n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^{L - 1}\\sum_{k = j + 1} ^ {L} |B_{j} - B_{k}| = \\sum_{j = 1}^{L - 1}\\sum_{k = j + 1} ^ {L} (B_{k} - B_{j}) =\\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} k(L - k)(B_{k + 1} - B_{k})\\]\n\nThis transformation is correct because \\(B_{a}-B_{b}=(B_{a}-B_{a-1}) + (B_{a-1}+B_{a-2}) + \\cdots +(B_{b+1}-B_{b})\\) for integers \\(a, b\\) satisfying \\(1\\leq b<a\\leq L\\), and the number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) satisfying \\(b\\leq k\\) and \\(k+1\\leq a\\) is \\(k(L-k)\\).\n\nIf we let \\(C_{k} = B_{k + 1} - B_{k}\\), then when \\(B\\) is sorted in ascending order and \\(B_{1} = 0\\), the following holds:\n- \\(0 \\leq C_{k}\\).\n- The sum of abs is equal to \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} k(L - k)C_{k}\\).\n- \\(\\displaystyle\\max(B) = B_{L} = \\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} C_{k}\\).\n\nTherefore, we need to solve the following problem: Determine if there exists a sequence of non-negative integers \\(C\\) of length \\(L - 1\\) such that \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{k = 1} ^ {L - 1} k(L - k)C_{k}  = A_{i}\\), and if it exists, find the minimum sum of such \\(C\\).\n\nThis can be solved using dynamic programming in the same manner as the knapsack problem, and it can be computed simultaneously for all \\(i\\).

As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\).

The set of actions consists of \u201cadding \\(x\\) to each element of \\(A\\) and \\(y\\) to that of \\(B\\) (within the segment)\u201d for all integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nFor a segment \\(a\\cdot2^k+1\\leq i\\leq (a+1)2^k\\) (where \\(L=a\\cdot2^k+1\\) and \\(R=(a+1)2^k\\)), it is insufficient to store the values \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\) for each segment. Instead, manage the length \\((R-L+1)\\), and three kinds of sum: \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R A_i\\), \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R B_i\\), and \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\), for each segment. Then, one can update the value \\(\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i)\\) in \\(O(1)\\) time. \n\nThe key updates are:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R ((A_i+x)\\times (B_i+y)) = \\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i\\times B_i) + y\\sum_{i=L}^R A_i + x\\sum_{i=L}^R B_i + (R-L+1)xy\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R (A_i+x) = \\sum_{i=L}^R A_i+(R-L+1)x, \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=L}^R (B_i+y) = \\sum_{i=L}^R B_i+(R-L+1)y\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the lazy segment tree can find the answer with a complexity of \\(O(Q\\log N)\\), which is efficient. The answer should be printed modulo \\(998244353\\).\n[END TEXT]\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nA real number \\( X \\) is given to the third decimal place.

For a graph with non-negative edge weights, the shortest length of a path can be found fast with Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. In this problem, vertices have weights too, so we cannot directly apply Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. Instead, we rephrase it into an edge-weighted problem. When traveling from vertex \\(U_i\\) to vertex \\(V_j\\) only via edge \\(j\\), the cost newly imposed is the cost to use edge \\(j\\) and to visit vertex \\(V_j\\), for a total of \\(B_j + A_{V_j}\\). Conversely, when traveling from vertex \\(V_i\\) to vertex \\(U_j\\) only via edge \\(j\\), the cost newly imposed is the cost to use edge \\(j\\) and to visit vertex \\(U_j\\), for a total of \\(B_j + A_{U_j}\\). Thus, by adding an edge of weight \\(B_j + A_{V_j}\\) in the direction of \\(U_j \\to V_j\\) and an edge of weight \\(B_j + A_{U_j}\\) in the direction of \\(V_j \\to U_j\\), every cost can be represented only with edge weights. By applying Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm on this graph and finally adding the weight of the initial point \\(A_1\\), one can find the answer.

We referred to an editorial slide by Yoichi Iwata. A city, road, and cost are simply a vertex, edge, and weight. In an optimal solution, the graph defined by the set of edges to be extended as well as their adjacent vertices forms a tree. For a subset of the vertex set \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}\\) and vertex \\(v\\), \\(f(S,v)\\) is the minimum total weight of the edges of a tree containing vertex \\(v\\) and all vertices in \\(S\\). We seek \\(f(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}, v)\\) for each \\(K\\leq v\\leq N\\).\n\nThe function \\(f(S,v)\\) can be calculated with Dynamic Programming (DP), using initial values \\(f(\\{i\\}, i)=0\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq K-1)\\).

The two queries can be processed as follows:\n\n- Addition and deletion of an edge are done by updating \\(A_i\\).\n- To find how far the connected component containing \\(x\\) extends to the right, \\(y > x\\) is connected to \\(x\\) if and only if \\(A[x] + \\ldots + A[y-1] = y-x\\). The maximum such \\(y\\) can be quickly found with binary search by finding the segment sum of \\(A\\). The same applies to the left.\n\nThe altered question can be solved by managing the array \\(A\\) in a segment tree.

Editorial by evima\n\nSolution: Let\u2019s denote the \\(i\\)-th operation as operation \\(i\\). For each operation, we will refer to the former choice as the left operation and the latter choice as the right operation. Consider the relationship between operations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) for all integer pairs \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(1 \\leq i < j \\leq Q\\).\n\n- When \\(V_i \\leq V_j\\): Any choice is fine.\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i = P_j\\): No matter what, Snuke will cry during operation \\(j\\), so the answer is \\(0\\).\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i < P_j\\): Operation \\(i\\) must be a left operation, and operation \\(j\\) must be a right operation.\n- When \\(V_i > V_j\\) and \\(P_i > P_j\\): Operation \\(i\\) must be a right operation, and operation \\(j\\) must be a left operation.\n\nAfter determining the direction of each operation in this way, if there is a contradiction, it is clear that the answer is \\(0\\). If there is no contradiction, the answer is at least \\(1\\). This is because, for any operation, the direction is set so that it can be performed after the previous operations. For those operations whose direction is not set, either choice is fine, so let \\(x\\) be the number of such operations, and the answer is \\(2^x\\) modulo \\(998244353\\).

In fact:\n\n1. Perform the operation with \\(k=1\\). This sorts the entire array if \\(P_1=1\\) in the initial state. Otherwise, we have \\(P_N \\neq 1\\) after the operation since \\(N \\geq 3\\).\n2. Next, perform the operation with \\(k=N\\). Since \\(P_N \\neq 1\\) before the operation, we have \\(P_1=1\\) after the operation.\n3. Perform the operation with \\(k=1\\). Since \\(P_1=1\\) before the operation, the entire array is certainly sorted after the operation.\n\nBy performing the above, any permutation can be sorted in at most three operations. Therefore, it is sufficient to quickly determine if the array can be sorted in zero, one, or two operations.\n\n- The determination for zero operations is trivial.\n- For one operation, if we fix \\(k\\), it is necessary and sufficient that the minimum and maximum values of \\((P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{k-1})\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(k-1\\), respectively, and \\(P_k=k\\). This can be checked in \\(O(1)\\) time for each \\(k\\) by taking cumulative \\(\\min\\) and \\(\\max\\), so the overall determination can be done in \\(O(N)\\) time.\n- For two operations, if \\(P_N \\neq 1\\), starting from the second of the three operations, the array can be sorted in two operations. Similarly, if \\(P_1 \\neq N\\), it can be sorted in two operations. Conversely, if \\(P_1=N\\) and \\(P_N=1\\), the relative positions of \\(1\\) and \\(N\\) in \\(P\\) do not change with one operation, leaving them in the order \\(N, 1\\). Therefore, \\(P\\) can be sorted in two or fewer operations \\(\\iff\\) \\(P_1 \\neq N\\) or \\(P_N \\neq 1\\). This can be checked in \\(O(1)\\) time.\n\nFrom the above, the answer for each test case can be found in \\(O(N)\\) time.\n \n\nSimilar Problem 2 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere are \\( N \\) types of elements numbered \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, N \\).

Determine if it is possible to create such a maze, and if possible, construct one.\n\nFor example, in the following figure, \\( N = 3 \\) and \\( M = 3 \\), and walls are placed at the solid lines (walls are always placed around the outer perimeter except for the entrance and exit). In this case, the path from the entrance to the exit passes through exactly 7 cells without any branches.\n\n### Formal Statement\n\nThere is a grid with \\( N \\) rows and \\( M \\) columns. Let \\((i, j)\\) denote the cell at the \\( i \\)-th row from the top and \\( j \\)-th column from the left. For each pair of side-adjacent cells, you can decide whether to place a wall between them. Determine whether it is possible to place walls to satisfy the following condition, and if it is possible, construct one such placement.\n\n**Condition**: There exists a simple path with \\( K \\) vertices that connects the two vertices \\((1, M)\\) and \\((N, M)\\), and the connected component containing the vertices \\((1, M)\\) and \\((N, M)\\) consists only of this path.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 2 \\leq N \\leq 100 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq M \\leq 100 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq K \\leq NM \\)\n- All input values are integers.\n\n### Input\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n```\nN M K\n```\n\n### Output\n\nIf there is no placement of walls that satisfies the condition, print `No`.

The number of connected components in the undirected graph corresponds to the number of cycles in the directed graph, so we will focus on the latter.\n\n1. **When \\(\\gcd(N, A) \\neq 1\\):**\n\n   Let \\(f^N(x)\\) represent the vertex reached after \\(N\\) moves starting from vertex \\(x\\). We have \\(\\displaystyle f^N(x)\\equiv A^N x + B\\frac{A^N-1}{A-1}\\ \\text{mod}\\ N\\). Here, let \\(d = \\gcd(N, A^N)\\). Since \\(\\displaystyle f^N(x+1)-f^N(x)\\equiv A^N\\equiv 0\\ \\text{mod}\\ d\\), the vertices forming a cycle all match \\(f^N(0)\\) modulo \\(d\\). Considering only these vertices, the problem can be reduced to the case where \\(\\displaystyle(N, A, B) \\leftarrow \\left(\\frac{N}{d}, A \\mod \\frac{N}{d}, \\frac{A^N}{d}B \\mod \\frac{N}{d}\\right)\\). By performing this substitution, the problem can be reduced to the case where \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\).\n\n2. **When \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\):**\n\n   If \\(\\gcd(N, A) = 1\\), all vertices form some cycle. Therefore, the answer is the sum of the reciprocals of the lengths of the cycles formed by each vertex. If vertex \\(x\\) returns to its original position after \\(K\\) moves, then \\(\\displaystyle A^K x + B\\frac{A^K-1}{A-1}\\equiv x\\ \\text{mod}\\ N\\), which implies \\(\\displaystyle A^K\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ \\frac{N(A-1)}{\\gcd(N(A-1), (A-1)x+B)}\\). Letting \\(G = \\gcd(A-1, B)\\), \\(A'=\\frac{A-1}{G}\\), \\(B'=\\frac{B}{G}\\), and \\(N'=\\frac{N}{\\gcd(A'^N, N)}\\), we have \\(\\displaystyle \\gcd(N(A-1), (A-1)x+B)=G\\gcd(N', A'x+B')\\). Since \\(A'\\) and \\(N'\\) are coprime, for each \\(0\\le y<N'\\), there exist exactly \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\) values \\(0\\le x<N\\) such that \\(y\\equiv A'x+B'\\ \\text{mod}\\ N'\\). Therefore, if we let \\(C_y\\) be the smallest positive integer \\(K\\) such that \\(\\displaystyle A^K\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ \\frac{NA'}{\\gcd(y, N')}\\) for each \\(0\\le y<N'\\), the desired answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\sum_{y=0}^{N'-1}\\frac{1}{C_y}\\). Values of \\(y\\) with the same \\(\\gcd(y, N')\\) have the same \\(C_y\\). Therefore, for each divisor \\(n\\) of \\(N'\\), we need to find the answer for \\(n = \\gcd(y, N')\\), and sum them up. The number of values \\(0\\le y<N'\\) such that \\(n = \\gcd(y, N')\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\left(\\frac{N'}{n}\\right)\\), so the answer can be expressed as \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{N}{N'}\\sum_{n| N'}\\frac{1}{C_n}\\phi\\left(\\frac{N'}{n}\\right)\\). Here, \\(\\phi\\) is the Euler\u2019s totient function.\n\nTo compute \\(C_n\\) for each \\(n\\), we can use the following facts:\n\n- By Euler\u2019s theorem, the candidates for \\(C_1\\) are divisors of \\(\\phi(NA')\\).\n- Let \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) be divisors of \\(N'\\). If \\(n_1\\) divides \\(n_2\\), then \\(C_{n_2}\\) divides \\(C_{n_1}\\).\n\nThis approach can be implemented using a DFS-like method. The value of \\(\\phi(NA')\\) and its prime factorization can be computed quickly by precomputing the prime factorizations of all positive integers up to \\(N\\).\n\n---\n\nThis concise editorial provides a clear breakdown of the problem-solving approach without unnecessary content.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_b", "arc182_f"]}, "abc341_f": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nTakahashi eats three plates for breakfast: rice, miso soup, and salad.

The following greedy strategy executed for each \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots , M\\) in order is valid.\n\nTo person \\(i\\), give the undistributed box containing at least \\(B_i\\) candies with the smallest number of candies in it. (Let us call this strategy \\((\\bigstar)\\).)\n\nWe will assume that this solution is not optimal to deduce a contradiction. Take an optimal solution. In this optimal solution, there is an \\(i\\) that violates the strategy \\((\\bigstar)\\). Take the minimum such \\(i\\). Let box \\(X\\) be the box that you would give to person \\(i\\) if you obey the strategy \\((\\bigstar)\\) up to \\(1,2,\\ldots, i-1, i\\). In the taken optimal solution, if box \\(X\\) is not given to anyone, then giving person \\(i\\) box \\(X\\) improves the solution, which contradicts the optimality. Thus you will give it to a person \\(j\\). Consider swapping the boxes to give to person \\(i\\) and to person \\(j\\). This operation keeps optimality, but the minimum \\(i\\) that violates \\((\\bigstar)\\) strictly increases, so repeating this yields a contradiction. Hence, the greedy algorithm has been justified.\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient to simulate this greedy algorithm fast enough. This can be done by using a data structure like `sortedcontainers.SortedList` in Python, or using the sliding window trick by using the fact that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be sorted without changing the answer.\n[END TEXT]\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc353_b", "abc358_d"]}, "abc342_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThere is a road extending infinitely to the east and west from a point called the origin, and \\( N \\) people are on the road.

The top-left cell is always outside; by performing BFS from this cell \nin four directions, one can reach all cells outside.\n\nExample: black cells represent lattice points with stones. Then, inspect each row. If there is a segment with \n\u201coutside stone inside \u2026 inside stone outside,\u201d then that segment can be counted as \u201cinside\u201d to count \u201cinside\u201d points. \nBeware of cases with consecutive stones, or stones between inside cells.\n\nNow we consider disconnected cases. It may seem we can consider each connected component independently, \nbut note that there may be a nested structure. After performing BFS for each connected component and determining whether \neach cell is outside or inside, when scanning the entire row, there may be parts like \n\u201coutside stone inside \u2026\u2026 outside stone inside \u2026\u2026 inside stone outside \u2026\u2026 inside stone outside,\u201d where some cells \ninside are labeled outside.\n\nEvery time you encounter \u201coutside, one or more stones, inside,\u201d the nest increases by one; for \n\u201cinside, one or more stones, outside,\u201d it decreases by one. By using this method to manage how many times the current \nposition is surrounded, one can handle this issue. Also, if there are different connected components sufficiently close \nto each other, the label (outside/inside) might be overwritten. This can be avoided by defining that stones are connected \nif the Chebyshev distance is two or less, instead of being eight-adjacent.\n'''\n```\n\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc371_f", "abc361_g"]}, "abc342_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou have an empty bag.

Both operations can increase or decrease the number of distinct numbers in the bag by one. Specifically, adding a ball increases the count by one or zero, and removing a ball decreases the count by one or zero. To determine if each operation affects the count, we need to check how many balls with a specific integer are in the bag. On insertion, if the bag already contains a ball with that number, the distinct count does not increase; otherwise, it increases by one. Similarly, on removal, the change in count depends on the number of balls with that specific integer. Thus, to process the queries, keep track of the current number of distinct integers with an integer and the number of balls with each integer in an array of length \\(10^6\\).

Let \\(dp[l][r]\\) denote the answer when considering only the interval \\([l,r]\\). We assume that when considering the interval \\([l,r]\\), only the intervals \\([L_i,R_i]\\) that satisfy \\(l \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq r\\) are given as conditions. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the values of \\(P_l,\\cdots,P_r\\) range from \\(1\\) to \\(r-l+1\\). Let\u2019s consider how to calculate \\(dp[l][r]\\).\n\nWe will do a case-by-case analysis based on the position \\(m\\) of the maximum value of \\(P_l,\\cdots,P_r\\). If there is a condition with \\(X_i=m\\), then that \\(m\\) is invalid. Consider the case without one. First, the conditions that satisfy \\(L_i \\leq m \\leq R_i\\) can be ignored from this point onward. This reduces the problem to calculating \\(dp[l][m-1]\\) and \\(dp[m+1][r]\\). Thus, we obtain the transition for \\(dp\\).\n\nNote that, since there is flexibility in the allocation of value sets to the left and right sides, it is necessary to multiply by the binomial coefficient corresponding to this. This gives us an \\(O(N^3)\\) DP solution.\n\nHere, it is necessary to enumerate the prohibited \\(m\\) for each \\([l,r]\\), but checking the \\(M\\) conditions each time would take \\(O(N^2 M)\\) time, which is too slow.

In fact:\n\n1. Perform the operation with \\(k=1\\). This sorts the entire array if \\(P_1=1\\) in the initial state. Otherwise, we have \\(P_N \\neq 1\\) after the operation since \\(N \\geq 3\\).\n2. Next, perform the operation with \\(k=N\\). Since \\(P_N \\neq 1\\) before the operation, we have \\(P_1=1\\) after the operation.\n3. Perform the operation with \\(k=1\\). Since \\(P_1=1\\) before the operation, the entire array is certainly sorted after the operation.\n\nBy performing the above, any permutation can be sorted in at most three operations. Therefore, it is sufficient to quickly determine if the array can be sorted in zero, one, or two operations.\n\n- The determination for zero operations is trivial.\n- For one operation, if we fix \\(k\\), it is necessary and sufficient that the minimum and maximum values of \\((P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{k-1})\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(k-1\\), respectively, and \\(P_k=k\\). This can be checked in \\(O(1)\\) time for each \\(k\\) by taking cumulative \\(\\min\\) and \\(\\max\\), so the overall determination can be done in \\(O(N)\\) time.\n- For two operations, if \\(P_N \\neq 1\\), starting from the second of the three operations, the array can be sorted in two operations. Similarly, if \\(P_1 \\neq N\\), it can be sorted in two operations.

The goal is to compute the sum of set bits in the result of bitwise AND operations between each integer from 0 to N and a given integer M with the following steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each bit position \\( j \\) from 0 to 59.\n2. If the \\( j \\)-th bit of \\( M \\) is set, for each \\( j \\), add to the result the count of integers between 0 and N whose \\( j \\)-th bit is set.\n3.

Given \\(k\\) coins \\((r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)\\), one can determine if there is a path that can collect all the coins as follows:\n\nSort the coins in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Here, \\((r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j) \\Leftrightarrow (r_i < r_j) \\lor (r_i = r_j \\land c_i < c_j)\\). Let \\(((r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k))\\) be the resulting sequence. There exists a path that can collect all the given \\(k\\) coins if and only if \\(c'_1 \\leq c'_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq c'_k\\).\n\nProof: If two coins $i$ and $j$ with $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$ are to be collected, coin $i$ has to be collected first. Thus, the $k$ coins $(r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)$ can be all collected if and only if the $k$ coins $(r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k)$ can be collected **in this order**. Given $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$, we have $(r_i \\leq r_j \\land c_i \\leq c_j) \\Leftrightarrow c_i \\leq c_j$, so the claim above has been shown.\n\nSuppose that the given \\(N\\) coins are sorted in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Then, by the fact above, this problem is boiled down to finding a longest (weakly) increasing subsequence (LIS). Given positive integer sequence \\(c=(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_N)\\), one can find the length of a LIS of \\(c\\) (not its length) by the following famous algorithm:\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\). Do the following for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\).\n\nFor the minimum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j > c_i\\), replace \\(d_j\\) with \\(c_i\\). The length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\).\n\nIntuitively, each \\(d_j\\) manages the smallest last element of a length-\\(j\\) (weakly) increasing subsequence of \\(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_i\\) (or \\(\\infty\\) if there is no such subsequence). To find an example of LIS instead of its length only, let us modify the algorithm as follows.\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\). Prepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(\\text{id}\\) and \\(\\text{pre}\\). Do the following for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\).\n\nFor the minimum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j > c_i\\), replace \\(d_j\\) with \\(c_i\\), and replace \\(\\text{id}_j\\) with \\(i\\). If \\(j > 1\\), replace \\(\\text{pre}_i\\) with \\(\\text{id}_{j-1}\\) too.\n\nThe length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\). Let \\(l\\) be the length of a LIS of \\(c\\). Consider a length-\\(l\\) sequence obtained by applying \\((l-1)\\) times the action \\(i\\mapsto \\text{pre}_i\\) to \\(\\text{id}_l\\), namely \\((\\text{id}_l, \\text{pre}_{\\text{id}_l},\\text{pre}_{\\text{pre}_{\\text{id}_l}},\\dots)\\). The reversal of this sequence is an example of a LIS of \\(c\\).\n\nThe fact that an example of LIS can be indeed obtained using this algorithm can be proved inductively. The complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(N\\log N)\\), same as the original algorithm. (To find the minimum \\(j\\) in step \\(3\\), use binary search.) Thus, the problem has been solved.\n\nSample code (Python3):\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_right\n\ndef main():\n    h, w, n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n    coins = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        coins.append((r, c))\n    coins.sort()\n    dp = [float('inf')] * n\n    id_list = [-1] * n\n    pre = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        it = bisect_right(dp, coins[i][1])\n        dp[it] = coins[i][1]\n        id_list[it] = i\n        pre[i] = id_list[it - 1] if it else -1\n    m = n - 1\n    while id_list[m] == -1:\n        m -= 1\n    path = [(h, w)]\n    now = id_list[m]\n    while now != -1:\n        path.append(coins[now])\n        now = pre[now]\n    path.append((1, 1))\n    path.reverse()\n    s = []\n    for i in range(len(path) - 1):\n        d = path[i + 1][0] - path[i][0]\n        r = path[i + 1][1] - path[i][1]\n        s.append('D' * d + 'R' * r)\n    print(m + 1)\n    print(''.join(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n\n", "problem_ids": ["abc370_e", "abc369_f"]}}
