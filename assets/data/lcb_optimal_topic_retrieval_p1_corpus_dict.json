Each word is composed of lowercase English letters and has the same fixed length across both lists. Our task is to find all words in `queries` that can be converted into any word in `dictionary` with at most two letter changes. We need to return these words in the same order they appear in `queries`.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Both `queries` and `dictionary` contain words of the same length.\n   - We can change any letter in a word from `queries` to any other letter, and we need to determine if it can match a word from `dictionary` with at most two such changes.\n   - The goal is to return a list of words from `queries` that meet this criterion.\n\n2. **Plan the Solution:**\n   - For each word in `queries`, compare it with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - Count the number of differing letters between each pair of words.\n   - If the count of differing letters is less than or equal to two, record the word from `queries`.\n\n3. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the words from `queries` that can match with words from `dictionary` with up to two edits.\n   - Use nested loops to compare each word in `queries` with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - For this comparison, iterate through the letters of both words simultaneously and count the differences.\n   - If the differences are two or fewer, add the word from `queries` to the result list and break out of the inner loop (since one match is enough).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations:**\n   - The time complexity is determined by the number of comparisons we make between the words.\n   - Each word comparison takes linear time relative to the word length.\n   - Given that the lengths of `queries` and `dictionary` can each be up to 100 and the word length can be up to 100, ensure your approach can handle the worst-case scenario efficiently.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider the following example:\n```python\nqueries = [\"word\", \"note\", \"ants\", \"wood\"]\ndictionary = [\"wood\", \"joke\", \"moat\"]\n```\n- Compare \"word\" with \"wood\": One edit needed ('r' to 'o'), so \"word\" matches.\n- Compare \"note\" with \"joke\": Two edits needed ('n' to 'j' and 't' to 'k'), so \"note\" matches.\n- Compare \"ants\" with all dictionary words: Requires more than two edits for each, so \"ants\" does not match.\n- Compare \"wood\" with \"wood\": No edits needed, so \"wood\" matches.\n\nThus, the output is `[\"word\", \"note\", \"wood\"]`.\n\n#### Algorithm Pseudocode:\n\n```text\ninitialize an empty list result\n\nfor each word s in queries:\n    for each word t in dictionary:\n        count differences between s and t\n        if differences are <= 2:\n            add s to result\n            break out of inner loop\n\nreturn result\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Ensure you correctly understand how to count the number of letter differences between two words efficiently.\n- Be mindful of the break condition in the inner loop \u2013 it helps avoid unnecessary comparisons once a match is found.\n- Use list comprehensions and Python's built-in functions efficiently for counting and managing iterations.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to implement a solution that identifies all words in `queries` that can be transformed into any word in `dictionary` with at most two edits.

Let's create a step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Understanding the Problem\n1. **Input and Output:**\n   - You are given an integer array `nums` with an even length.\n   - You need to simulate a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing the smallest element from `nums`.\n   - Bob will append his removed element to an initially empty array `arr`, and then Alice does the same.\n   - Continue until `nums` is empty.\n   - Your task is to return the resulting array `arr`.\n\n2. **Rules of the Game:**\n   - In each round:\n     - Alice removes the smallest element from `nums`.\n     - Then Bob does the same from the remaining elements of `nums`.\n     - Bob appends his removed element to `arr`.\n     - Then Alice appends her removed element to `arr`.\n   - Repeat until `nums` becomes empty.\n\n#### Approach to Solve the Problem\nWe need to simulate this game step-by-step while maintaining specific ordering and operations as described.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Start with the given `nums` array.\n   - Prepare an empty array `arr` where you will store the resulting elements as per the game rules.\n\n2. **Using a Min Heap:**\n   - A min heap is very efficient for repeatedly fetching and removing the smallest element. By using this structure, you can easily get the smallest elements.\n   - Convert the `nums` array into a min heap. This allows efficient extraction of the minimum elements.\n\n3. **Simulating the Game:**\n   - While `nums` is not empty:\n     - Alice removes the smallest element from `nums` (which is the root of the heap).\n     - Bob removes the next smallest element from the remaining `nums`.\n     - Bob appends his removed element to `arr`.\n     - Alice appends her removed element to `arr`.\n\n4. **Return the Result:**\n   - Once all elements are moved from `nums` to `arr` according to the rules, return the array `arr`.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Convert `nums` to a Min Heap:**\n   - Use a priority queue (min heap) to store all elements of `nums`.\n\n2. **Iterate Until `nums` is Empty:**\n   - While there are elements in `nums`:\n     - Extract the smallest element (Alice's turn).\n     - Extract the next smallest element (Bob's turn).\n     - Append Bob's extracted element to `arr`.\n     - Append Alice's extracted element to `arr`.\n\n3. **Complexity Considerations:**\n   - **Time complexity:** Converting an array into a heap and extracting elements from it both rely heavily on `O(log n)` operations, making the overall time complexity `O(n log n)`.\n   - **Space complexity:** The space complexity remains `O(n)` due to the storage required for `arr`.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nConsider `nums = [5, 4, 2, 3]`:\n1. Convert `nums` into a min heap: `[2, 3, 5, 4]`.\n2. Iterations:\n   - **Round 1:**\n     - Alice removes `2` (smallest element from the heap).\n     - Bob removes `3` (next smallest element from the heap).\n     - Append `3` to `arr` (Bob's turn): `arr = [3]`.\n     - Append `2` to `arr` (Alice's turn): `arr = [3, 2]`.\n   - **Round 2:**\n     - Remaining `nums` as a min heap: `[4, 5]`.\n     - Alice removes `4` (smallest element).\n     - Bob removes `5` (next smallest element).\n     - Append `5` to `arr`: `arr = [3, 2, 5]`.\n     - Append `4` to `arr`: `arr = [3, 2, 5, 4]`.\n3. Return `arr`.\n\nBy following this strategy, you ensure the rules are adhered to and the array `nums` is processed correctly.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def numberGame(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        heapify(nums)\n        ans = []\n        while nums:\n            a, b = heappop(nums), heappop(nums)\n            ans.append(b)\n            ans.append(a)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-number-game"]}, "2730": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "2754": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThere exists an undirected tree with n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1.

An undirected tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`.\n2. A 2D integer array `edges` of length `n-1`, where each entry `[ui, vi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.\n3. A positive integer `k`.\n4. An array `nums` of non-negative integers of length `n`.\n\n#### Goal\nMaximize the sum of the values of the nodes in the tree by performing an operation any number of times, where the operation is:\n- Select an edge `[u, v]`.\n- Update `nums[u]` and `nums[v]` with `nums[u] XOR k` and `nums[v] XOR k`.\n\n### Understanding XOR and Its Properties\nThe XOR operation (`^`) has specific properties:\n1. XORing a number with itself yields zero (x ^ x = 0).\n2. XORing a number with zero leaves it unchanged (x ^ 0 = x).\n3. The result of XORing `x` with `k` twice is `x` again (x ^ k ^ k = x).\n\n### Key Insight\n- When a number is XORed with `k` an even number of times, it returns to its original value.\n- The sum of the array `nums` will reach its maximum when the optimal number of elements are XORed with `k`.\n\n### Dynamic Programming Solution\nWe can effectively use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We need to track two states as we iterate through the `nums` array:\n1. The maximum sum (`f0`) when an even number of elements have been XORed with `k`.\n2. The maximum sum (`f1`) when an odd number of elements have been XORed with `k`.\n\n#### State Transition Equations\nLet's define two variables `f0` and `f1`:\n- `f0` - The maximum sum when an even number of elements have been XORed.\n- `f1` - The maximum sum when an odd number of elements have been XORed.\n\nFor each element `x` in `nums`, we have two possibilities: we either add `x` to the current state or add `x XOR k` to the alternate state:\n1. Update `f0` to be the maximum of:\n   - `f0 + x` (keeping `x` unmodified in an even state)\n   - `f1 + (x XOR k)` (moving from an odd state by modifying `x` and switching to even)\n   \n2. Update `f1` to be the maximum of:\n   - `f1 + x` (keeping `x` unmodified in an odd state)\n   - `f0 + (x XOR k)` (moving from an even state by modifying `x` and switching to odd)\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1. Initialize `f0` to `0` (maximum sum with even number of XOR operations).\n2. Initialize `f1` to negative infinity (since initially, we don't have an odd number of operations, this should be very low).\n3. Iterate through each number in the `nums` array, and update `f0` and `f1` using the above state transition equations.\n4. The maximum possible sum is stored in `f0` after processing all elements.\n\n### Final Step\nReturn `f0` as it will contain the maximum possible sum after considering all elements and possible operations.\n\nBy following this guide, you will be able to solve the problem step-by-step without missing any important detail.

Here, \"unique\" means that the substring should not appear as a part of any other string in the given array. If multiple such substrings exist, you should select the one that is lexicographically smallest (i.e., dictionary order). If no such substring exists, you should return an empty string for that particular string.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem comprehensively:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**\n    - You have an array of strings.\n    - Your task is to find the shortest substring for each string in the array that does not occur in any other string in the array.\n    - If multiple shortest substrings exist, choose the smallest one based on lexicographical order.\n    - If no such substring exists, the answer for that string should be an empty string.\n\n2. **Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n    1. **Initialization:**\n        - Create a list named `ans` of the same length as the input array `arr`, initialized with empty strings. This list will store the required shortest unique substring for each corresponding string in `arr`.\n\n    2. **Enumerate Each String:**\n        - Loop over each string in the array `arr` using an index `i`. For each string `s`, determine its length `m`.\n\n    3. **Enumerate All Possible Substrings:**\n        - For a given string `s`, you need to enumerate all possible substrings. Start with the shortest possible substrings and gradually increase their length.\n        - Use two nested loops: one for the length of the substring (from 1 to the length of `s`), and the other for the starting position of the substring within `s`.\n\n    4. **Check Uniqueness:**\n        - For each substring, check if it appears in any other string in the array.\n        - If a substring does not exist in any other string and is either the first candidate or lexicographically smaller than the current candidate, update the answer for the current string `s`.\n        - If you find a valid substring for the current string, you can stop further checks for larger substrings.\n\n3. **Check Substring Existence:**\n    - For each substring, you need to ensure it doesn't appear in any other string within the array. This can be done using a generator expression or nested loops.\n\n4. **Final Return:**\n    - After processing all strings in the array, return the list `ans`, which now contains the shortest unique substrings for each string in the input array.\n\n### Detailed Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's go through an example with the input `arr = [\"cab\", \"ad\", \"bad\", \"c\"]`:\n\n- For the string \"cab\":\n    - Enumerate substrings starting with length 1: \"c\", \"a\", \"b\".\n    - \"c\" appears in \"c\", so it's not unique.\n    - \"a\" appears in \"ad\" and \"bad\", so it's not unique.\n    - \"b\" appears in \"bad\", so it's not unique.\n    - Increase substring length to 2: \"ca\", \"ab\".\n    - \"ca\" doesn't appear in any other string but \"ab\" is lexicographically smaller.\n    - \"ab\" is the shortest unique substring for \"cab\".\n\n- For the string \"ad\":\n    - Length 1: \"a\", \"d\".\n    - \"a\" appears in \"bad\" and \"cab\".\n    - \"d\" appears in \"bcd\".\n    - Length 2: \"ad\".\n    - \"ad\" appears in \"abcd\".\n    - No unique substring for \"ad\".\n\n- For the string \"bad\":\n    - Length 1: \"b\", \"a\", \"d\".\n    - All appear in other strings.\n    - Length 2: \"ba\", \"ad\".\n    - \"ba\" doesn't appear in any other string.\n    - \"ba\" is the shortest unique substring for \"bad\".\n\n- For the string \"c\":\n    - Length 1: \"c\" appears in \"cab\" and \"bcd\".\n    - No unique substring for \"c\".\n\nThe result array will be `[\"ab\", \"\", \"ba\", \"\"]`.\n\n### Key Concepts to Remember:\n\n- Enumerate substrings from shortest to longest.\n- Use nested loops to check each substring's existence in other strings.\n- Ensure the shortest and lexicographically smallest substring is selected.\n- Break the loop for a string once you find a valid substring.\n\nBy following these steps and logic, you will be able to solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubstrings(self, arr: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        ans = [\"\"] * len(arr)\n        for i, s in enumerate(arr):\n            m = len(s)\n            for j in range(1, m + 1):\n                for l in range(m - j + 1):\n                    sub = s[l : l + j]\n                    if not ans[i] or ans[i] > sub:\n                        if all(k == i or sub not in t for k, t in enumerate(arr)):\n                            ans[i] = sub\n                if ans[i]:\n                    break\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["shortest-uncommon-substring-in-an-array"]}, "2756": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\nThe initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\nIf more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    \nIncrease the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.\n        \nFor example, say you start with the words [\"abcdef\",\"abndef\"] both initially abbreviated as \"a4f\".

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "2757": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2).

Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for solving this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nYou are given a string `s` representing a mathematical expression containing only digits (0-9), plus symbols `+`, and multiplication symbols `*`. The expression needs to be evaluated according to the following rules:\n\n1. **Compute multiplications** from left to right.\n2. **Compute additions** from left to right.\n\nAdditionally, you are provided with an array `answers`, which contains the answers submitted by several students. Your task is to grade each student's answer based on the correctness of the arithmetic operations they performed, possibly considering they may have misinterpreted the order of operations. Points are awarded as follows:\n\n- **5 points** if the student's answer is exactly correct.\n- **2 points** if the student's answer is a valid result of the expression assuming they misinterpreted the order.\n- **0 points** if neither of the above conditions are met.\n\nYou need to compute the total points awarded to the students based on these rules.\n\n#### Breakdown of Solution Approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the Correct Answer:**\n    - Implement a function that evaluates the given string `s` correctly following the specified order: first calculate all multiplications, then additions.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming to Find All Valid Results:**\n    - Use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to store all possible results of sub-expressions in a 2D table `f[i][j]`, where `f[i][j]` stores all possible results from calculating the expression between the `i`-th and `j`-th digits.\n   \n3. **Fill DP Table:**\n    - Initialize the DP table for single digits.\n    - For larger sub-expressions, compute results using previously computed values from smaller sub-expressions, considering all possible places where the expression can be split.\n\n4. **Compute Student Points:**\n    - Check each student's answer against the correct answer.\n    - If it matches, award 5 points.\n    - If it doesn't match but is in the list of possible results (from the DP table), award 2 points.\n    - Otherwise, award 0 points.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Correct Answer:**\n    - Traverse the string `s` and compute the result by:\n      - Multiplying numbers together whenever a `*` is encountered.\n      - Adding the results of multiplications when a `+` is encountered.\n\n2. **Initialize and Fill DP Table:**\n    - Use a 2D list `f` initialized to store sets of possible results for each sub-expression.\n    - For single-digit sub-expressions, simply store the digit itself.\n    - For larger sub-expressions:\n      - Break the expression at each possible point, applying the operator between the resulting sub-expressions.\n      - Store all valid results considering each operation result must not exceed `1000`.\n\n3. **Evaluate Student Answers:**\n    - Use a counter to tally how many times each answer appears in `answers`.\n    - For each answer, check if it matches the correct answer or is in the list of valid sub-expression results.\n    - Sum up the points based on the points criteria given.\n\nUsing this detailed structured approach helps in solving the problem efficiently by breaking it down into manageable parts and utilizing dynamic programming to handle sub-expression calculations effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def scoreOfStudents(self, s: str, answers: List[int]) -> int:\n        def cal(s: str) -> int:\n            res, pre = 0, int(s[0])\n            for i in range(1, n, 2):\n                if s[i] == \"*\":\n                    pre *= int(s[i + 1])\n                else:\n                    res += pre\n                    pre = int(s[i + 1])\n            res += pre\n            return res\n\n        n = len(s)\n        x = cal(s)\n        m = (n + 1) >> 1\n        f = [[set() for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(m)]\n        for i in range(m):\n            f[i][i] = {int(s[i << 1])}\n        for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):\n            for j in range(i, m):\n                for k in range(i, j):\n                    for l in f[i][k]:\n                        for r in f[k + 1][j]:\n                            if s[k << 1 | 1] == \"+\" and l + r <= 1000:\n                                f[i][j].add(l + r)\n                            elif s[k << 1 | 1] == \"*\" and l * r <= 1000:\n                                f[i][j].add(l * r)\n        cnt = Counter(answers)\n        ans = cnt[x] * 5\n        for k, v in cnt.items():\n            if k != x and k in f[0][m - 1]:\n                ans += v << 1\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["the-score-of-students-solving-math-expression"]}, "2777": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.\nPartition the cards into one or more groups such that:\n\nEach group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and\nAll the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.\n\nReturn true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: No possible partition.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= deck.length <= 104\n0 <= deck[i] < 104\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "2779": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "2784": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k.\nA subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k.\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array nums.\nA subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2. Initiate the counter and subset count.\n3. Call the `dfs(0)` to start from the first element.\n4. Return the final count of beautiful subsets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution to find all beautiful subsets of the given array.

These boards direct balls either to the right or to the left. You will drop a ball into each column from the top, and your task is to determine where each ball will exit from the bottom, or whether it will get stuck.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the right spans the cell from the top-left to bottom-right and is represented as `1`.\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the left spans the cell from the top-right to bottom-left and is represented as `-1`.\n\n2. **Ball Movement and Stuck Conditions:**\n   - If the ball is redirected to the left at the leftmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If the ball is redirected to the right at the rightmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If adjacent cells form a 'V' shape (e.g., current cell is `1` with next cell to the right being `-1` or vice versa), the ball gets stuck.\n\n**Approach to Solution:**\n\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Simulation:**\n   - Create a DFS function to simulate the ball's movement from a given starting position.\n   - Use recursion to determine the ball's path as it moves down the grid.\n\n2. **Base Conditions for Ball Getting Stuck:**\n   - Check if the ball hits the box boundaries or a 'V' shape formed by adjacent boards.\n   - Return `-1` if any of these conditions are met.\n\n3. **Recursive Ball Movement:**\n   - If the ball moves correctly to the next row, recursively apply the DFS to the new position.\n   - When the ball reaches the last row, return the current column as the exit column.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Each Column:**\n   - For each column at the top, initiate the DFS and record the result.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialize Parameters:**\n   - Determine the number of rows `m` and columns `n` of the grid.\n\n2. **Define DFS Function:**\n   - The DFS function takes the current row and column as parameters.\n   - If the ball reaches the last row, return the current column.\n   - Check the following conditions for getting stuck:\n     - Ball tries to move left in the leftmost column, or right in the rightmost column.\n     - Adjacent cells form a 'V' shape.\n   - Recursively move the ball's position based on the board's direction.\n\n3. **Execute DFS for Each Column:**\n   - Iterate over each column at the top and use the DFS function to track the ball's final position or if it gets stuck.\n   - Store the result for each column in an answer list.\n\n4. **Output Results:**\n   - Return the list containing the exit columns or `-1` for each ball.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nConsider the grid:\n```\n[[ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1,  1,  1],\n [ 1,  1,  1,  1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]\n```\nEach ball will be dropped in each column. Using DFS:\n- Ball dropped at column 0 exits at column 1.\n- Ball dropped at column 1 gets stuck in a 'V' shape in columns 2 and 3 in the first or second row.\n- Repeat the process for each column.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nBy following the simulation approach with DFS and handling the boundary and 'V' shape conditions, you can determine the exit column of each ball or identify if it gets stuck. This approach ensures that you comprehensively track the ball's journey through the grid.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def findBall(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:\n            if i == m:\n                return j\n            if j == 0 and grid[i][j] == -1:\n                return -1\n            if j == n - 1 and grid[i][j] == 1:\n                return -1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == -1:\n                return -1\n            if grid[i][j] == -1 and grid[i][j - 1] == 1:\n                return -1\n            return dfs(i + 1, j + 1) if grid[i][j] == 1 else dfs(i + 1, j - 1)\n\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        return [dfs(0, j) for j in range(n)]\n", "problem_ids": ["where-will-the-ball-fall"]}, "2786": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and a non-negative integer k.

Here\u2019s a detailed guide to help you solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', and a non-negative integer `k`. You need to determine the minimum number of minutes required to take at least `k` of each character ('a', 'b', and 'c') from either the leftmost or the rightmost end of the string. If it's not possible to take `k` of each character, you should return `-1`.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - Input: s = \"aabaaaacaabc\", k = 2\n   - You can approach from both ends of the string to take characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n   - One possible way: \n     - Take three characters from the left (\"aab\"). You have two 'a' characters and one 'b'.\n     - Take five characters from the right (\"caabc\"). You get additional two 'a', one 'b', and two 'c'.\n     - Total time: 3 + 5 = 8 minutes\n   - Output: 8\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - Input: s = \"a\", k = 1\n   - Not possible to have at least one 'b' or 'c'.\n   - Output: -1\n\n### Plan and Approach\n\n1. **Initial Check**: \n   - First, count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string `s`. If any of these characters appear less than `k` times, you can directly return `-1` because it's impossible to collect `k` of each character.\n\n2. **Reverse Problem**:\n   - Think of the problem in reverse: instead of trying to keep characters from both ends, think about removing a substring in the middle. The characters remaining on the sides should still have at least `k` of each 'a', 'b', and 'c'. \n\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - Maintain a sliding window to represent the substring you are \"removing\" from the middle.\n   - Use two pointers, `j` (left boundary) and `i` (right boundary) of the window, initialized to 0.\n   - As you expand the window by moving `i`, decrement the count of the character `s[i]` from the total count.\n\n4. **Window Adjustment**:\n   - If the count of the character being decremented (due to expanding the window) drops below `k`, increment `j` to shrink the window from the left until all characters outside the window have at least `k` count.\n\n5. **Track Maximum Window Size**:\n   - Keep track of the maximum size of the window you can maintain while each character outside the window still has at least `k` counts.\n   - The number of minutes required will be the length of the entire string minus the maximum size of the window.\n\n### Pseudocode Outline\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each character in `s`.\n2. If any character count is less than `k`, return `-1`.\n3. Initialize variables: `mx = 0`, `j = 0`, and a sliding window over the string with the right boundary `i`.\n4. For each character at position `i` in the string:\n   - Decrement the count of this character.\n   - If count of any character drops below `k`, move `j` to the right until the count is restored to at least `k`.\n   - Update `mx` with the current maximum window size.\n5. Return the result as the length of the string minus `mx`.\n\n### Final Thought\n\n- Consider edge cases such as strings with minimum length, `k` being zero, which should immediately imply that no characters need to be taken, or strings significantly longer than `k`.\n\nBy understanding and applying these steps, you should be able to solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def takeCharacters(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        cnt = Counter(s)\n        if any(cnt[c] < k for c in \"abc\"):\n            return -1\n        mx = j = 0\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            cnt[c] -= 1\n            while cnt[c] < k:\n                cnt[s[j]] += 1\n                j += 1\n            mx = max(mx, i - j + 1)\n        return len(s) - mx\n", "problem_ids": ["take-k-of-each-character-from-left-and-right"]}, "2791": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point (0, 0) facing north.

The robot starts from the origin (0, 0) and can move or change direction based on a sequence of commands. Additionally, certain grid points may have obstacles that the robot needs to avoid. The goal is to determine the maximum Euclidean distance squared that the robot achieves from the origin during its journey.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solve this problem:\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding Directions and Commands\n\n1. **Directions**: The robot can face four main directions:\n   - **North**: Positive Y direction.\n   - **East**: Positive X direction.\n   - **South**: Negative Y direction.\n   - **West**: Negative X direction.\n\n2. **Commands**:\n   - **-2**: Turn left 90 degrees.\n   - **-1**: Turn right 90 degrees.\n   - **1 to 9**: Move forward by `k` units, where k ranges from 1 to 9.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Setup\n\n- Define a list or array to represent the directions. A convenient way is to use an ordered representation such as `[0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`. Here, consecutive pairs represent directions: \n  - `(0, 1)` for North,\n  - `(1, 0)` for East,\n  - `(0, -1)` for South, and\n  - `(-1, 0)` for West.\n\n- Utilize variables `x` and `y` to track the robot\u2019s current position. Start with `x = 0` and `y = 0`.\n\n- Use a variable `k` to track the direction index initially set to point to North, i.e., `0`.\n\n#### Step 3: Handling Obstacles\n\n- Convert the list of obstacle coordinates into a set for quick lookup. This enables you to check if a given position is an obstacle in constant time (O(1)).\n\n#### Step 4: Process Each Command\n\n- Iterate through each command in the sequence:\n  1. **Turning Left (-2)**: Adjust the direction index to the left by using `(k + 3) % 4`.\n  2. **Turning Right (-1)**: Adjust the direction index to the right by using `(k + 1) % 4`.\n  3. **Moving Forward (1 to 9)**:\n     - For each step:\n         - Calculate the next position based on the current direction.\n         - If the next position is not an obstacle, update the robot's position.\n         - Calculate the Euclidean distance squared from the origin $(x^2 + y^2)$ and keep track of the maximum distance encountered.\n\n#### Step 5: Return the Result\n\n- After processing all the commands, the maximum Euclidean distance squared found during the simulation is your answer.\n\n### Summary of Simulation Process:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from `(0, 0)` facing North.\n2. **Use Directions Array**: Handle direction changes using a list `[0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`.\n3. **Obstacle Set**: Convert obstacle list to set.\n4. **Iterate Commands**: Process each command by adjusting direction or moving the robot.\n5. **Update Position**: Move and check for obstacles, update maximum distance.\n6. **Result**: Return the maximum Euclidean distance squared.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution and solve the problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def robotSim(self, commands: List[int], obstacles: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        dirs = (0, 1, 0, -1, 0)\n        s = {(x, y) for x, y in obstacles}\n        ans = k = 0\n        x = y = 0\n        for c in commands:\n            if c == -2:\n                k = (k + 3) % 4\n            elif c == -1:\n                k = (k + 1) % 4\n            else:\n                for _ in range(c):\n                    nx, ny = x + dirs[k], y + dirs[k + 1]\n                    if (nx, ny) in s:\n                        break\n                    x, y = nx, ny\n                    ans = max(ans, x * x + y * y)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["walking-robot-simulation"]}, "2792": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "2800": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nDesign a text editor with a cursor that can do the following:\n\nAdd text to where the cursor is.\nDelete text from where the cursor is (simulating the backspace key).\nMove the cursor either left or right.\n\nWhen deleting text, only characters to the left of the cursor will be deleted.

In this problem, you will be designing a text editor that supports adding text, deleting text, and moving the cursor within the text. The text editor's functionality is defined by the following operations:\n\n1. **Add Text**: Add text to the position of the cursor.\n2. **Delete Text**: Delete text to the left of the cursor.\n3. **Move Cursor Left**: Move the cursor a specified number of positions to the left.\n4. **Move Cursor Right**: Move the cursor a specified number of positions to the right.\n\nHere\u2019s a structured method to help you solve the problem efficiently:\n\n#### Step 1: Initialize the Data Structure\n- **Concept**: Use two stacks (`left` and `right`) to manage the text efficiently. \n    - **Left Stack**: Stores the characters to the left of the cursor.\n    - **Right Stack**: Stores the characters to the right of the cursor.\n\n    - **Why Stacks?**: Stacks allow efficient additions and deletions from one end (the top), making it suitable for cursor management.\n\n#### Step 2: Add Text\n- **Procedure**:\n    1. For adding text, append each character of the text to the `left` stack.\n    2. After adding text, the cursor should be placed just after the newly added text.\n\n    - **Example**: Adding \"leetcode\" when the cursor is at \"|\", would transform the text to `[\"l\", \"e\", \"e\", \"t\", \"c\", \"o\", \"d\", \"e\"]|`.\n\n#### Step 3: Delete Text\n- **Procedure**:\n    1. Determine how many characters should be deleted, which is the minimum of `k` and the number of characters in the `left` stack.\n    2. Remove characters one by one from the `left` stack up to the determined count.\n    3. Return the count of actually deleted characters.\n\n    - **Example**: Deleting 4 characters from \"leetcode|\" would result in \"leet|\".\n\n#### Step 4: Move Cursor Left\n- **Procedure**:\n    1. Determine how many positions to move the cursor, which is the minimum of `k` and the number of characters in the `left` stack.\n    2. Pop characters one by one from the `left` stack and push them onto the `right` stack.\n    3. Return the last 10 characters from the `left` stack as a string.\n\n    - **Example**: Moving the cursor left by 8 positions from \"leetcode|\" would result in \"|leetcode\".\n\n#### Step 5: Move Cursor Right\n- **Procedure**:\n    1. Determine how many positions to move the cursor, which is the minimum of `k` and the number of characters in the `right` stack.\n    2. Pop characters one by one from the `right` stack and push them onto the `left` stack.\n    3. Return the last 10 characters from the `left` stack as a string.\n\n    - **Example**: Moving the cursor right by 6 positions from \"|leetcode\" would result in \"leetco|de\".\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\nLet's walk through an example to clarify how the operations work together:\n\n1. **Initiate the Editor**:\n    - Current Text: `|`\n\n2. **Add Text**: \"leetcode\"\n    - Current Text: `leetcode|`\n  \n3. **Delete Text**: 4 characters\n    - Current Text: `leet|`\n    - Characters Deleted: 4\n  \n4. **Add Text**: \"practice\"\n    - Current Text: `leetpractice|`\n  \n5. **Cursor Right**: 3 positions\n    - Current Text: `leetpractice|`\n    - Returns: \"etpractice\" (last 10 characters to the left of the cursor)\n  \n6. **Cursor Left**: 8 positions\n    - Current Text: `leet|practice`\n    - Returns: \"leet\"\n  \n7. **Delete Text**: 10 characters\n    - Current Text: `|practice`\n    - Characters Deleted: 4\n  \n8. **Cursor Left**: 2 positions\n    - Current Text: `|practice`\n    - Returns: \"\"\n  \n9. **Cursor Right**: 6 positions\n    - Current Text: `practi|ce`\n    - Returns: \"practi\"\n\n#### Performance Consideration\n- Each operation involving cursor movement or text manipulation should be handled within O(k) time complexity, where `k` is the number of positions for cursor movement or the number of characters to be deleted.\n  \nBy following these steps and considerations, you should be able to implement an efficient text editor that meets the problem's requirements.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2. Initiate the counter and subset count.\n3. Call the `dfs(0)` to start from the first element.\n4. Return the final count of beautiful subsets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution to find all beautiful subsets of the given array.

A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the original sequence, but the remaining elements should stay in their original order.\n\n**Examples for Clarity:**\n- Example 1: For [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5], the output is 6 because the entire sequence is already a wiggle sequence.\n- Example 2: For [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8], the output is 7 for subsequence [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8].\n- Example 3: For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the output is 2 for subsequence [1, 9].\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem Using Dynamic Programming:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define two arrays `up` and `down`. \n   - `up[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with an upward trend.\n   - `down[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with a downward trend.\n   - Initialize both arrays with `1` because any single element sequence has a wiggle length of `1`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last.\n   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with all preceding elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend a downward trend sequence ending at `j` to an upward trend at `i`. Update `up[i]` as the maximum of `up[i]` and `down[j] + 1`.\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend an upward trend sequence ending at `j` to a downward trend at `i`. Update `down[i]` as the maximum of `down[i]` and `up[j] + 1`.\n   - Update an overall maximum length `ans` by comparing `up[i]` and `down[i]` after each iteration.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The longest wiggle subsequence length will be the maximum value in the last `ans`, which you maintain throughout the iteration.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to nested loops (iterating each element and comparing it with all preceding elements).\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 7, 4]`:\n\n- Initialize `up = [1, 1, 1]` and `down = [1, 1, 1]`.\n- For `i = 1`, compare `nums[1] (7)` with `nums[0] (1)`:\n  - `7 > 1`, so `up[1] = max(up[1], down[0] + 1)` which results in `up[1] = 2`. Update `ans` to 2 since it's the maximum between `up[1]` and `down[1]`.\n- For `i = 2`, compare `nums[2] (4)` with `nums[0] (1)` and `nums[1] (7)`:\n  - `4 > 1`, so nothing changes because `up[2]` remains 1.\n  - `4 < 7`, so `down[2] = max(down[2], up[1] + 1)` which results in `down[2] = 3`. Update `ans` to 3 (now maximum between `up[2]` and `down[2]`).\n\n- The final length is `max(up[2], down[2])`, which is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop a solution to find the longest wiggle subsequence effectively.

Let's walk through how to solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe need to compute the sum of all XOR totals for every possible subset of a given array `nums`. XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares each bit of its operands. For instance, the XOR of 2 (0010 in binary) and 5 (0101 in binary) is 7 (0111 in binary).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Represent Subsets Using Binary Numbers\n- Each subset of an array can be represented by a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included in the subset (1) or not (0).\n- For example, an array `[a, b, c]` has its subsets represented by:\n  - `000` (empty subset)\n  - `001` (subset with only `c`)\n  - `010` (subset with only `b`)\n  - `011` (subset with `b` and `c`)\n  - and so on.\n\n#### 2. Enumerate All Subsets\n- You can enumerate all subsets by considering all binary numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. In binary form, each number in this range corresponds to a subset.\n\n#### 3. Calculate XOR for Each Subset\n- For each subset represented by binary number `i`, check each bit position. Include the element in the subset if the bit is `1`.\n- Compute the XOR for all included elements.\n\n#### 4. Sum All XOR Results\n- Maintain a running total of the XOR results from all subsets. \n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Create a variable to store the total sum of all XOR results.\n\n2. **Loop Through All Possible Subsets:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through all integers from `0` to `2^n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Each Element:**\n   - For each subset, check each bit of the current integer:\n     - If the bit at position `j` is `1`, include the `j`-th element of `nums` in the subset.\n\n4. **Compute XOR for the Current Subset:**\n   - Initialize a variable for the current XOR total. For each `1` bit found, XOR it with the current total.\n\n5. **Add the XOR Result to Total:**\n   - After computing the XOR for the current subset, add it to the running total.\n\n6. **Return the Total Sum:**\n   - Once all subsets are processed, return the running total.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's say the array is `[1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `total_sum = 0`\n\n2. **Generate Subsets:**\n   - The length `n = 2`, so iterate over `i` from `0` to `3` (`2^2 - 1`).\n\n3. **Subset by `i = 0` (`00` in binary):**\n   - No elements included. XOR total = `0`.\n   - Add `0` to `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Subset by `i = 1` (`01` in binary):**\n   - Include element `1`. XOR total = `1`.\n   - Add `1` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 1`.\n\n5. **Subset by `i = 2` (`10` in binary):**\n   - Include element `3`. XOR total = `3`.\n   - Add `3` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 4`.\n\n6. **Subset by `i = 3` (`11` in binary):**\n   - Include elements `1` and `3`. XOR total = `1 XOR 3 = 2`.\n   - Add `2` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 6`.\n\nFinal output is `6`, as the sum of all XOR totals for every subset is `6`.\n\nUsing this structured approach will help you understand and solve the problem efficiently.

The game has specific rules for choosing words from these arrays. Alice starts the game by playing the smallest word in her list. \n\nThe key points to remember:\n- A word that is played must be \"closely greater\" than the previous word, meaning it is lexicographically greater and adheres to specific conditions.\n- If a player can't make a move, they lose.\n\nThe objective is to determine whether Alice can ensure her victory if both players play optimally.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n    - Alice plays the smallest word from her array `a`, so start by picking `a[0]`.\n2. **Turn Indication**:\n    - Use a variable `k` where `k = 0` means it's Alice's turn, and `k = 1` means it's Bob's turn.\n3. **Indices Tracking**:\n    - Use two indices `i` and `j` to track the current word being considered by Alice and Bob respectively (`i` for Alice, `j` for Bob).\n4. **Condition for Next Word**:\n    - The next word must be lexicographically greater and either:\n        - Have the same first letter, or\n        - Have a first letter that is the subsequent letter of the alphabet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n    - Start by setting `i = 1` since Alice has already played `a[0]`.\n    - Initialize `j = 0` for Bob and `w = a[0]` as the currently played word.\n    - Set `k = 1` initially to indicate it's Bob's turn next.\n\n2. **Game Loop**:\n    - While the game continues, you will check whose turn it is and evaluate the possible moves.\n    \n    - **If it's Bob's turn (`k = 1`)**:\n        - Check if Bob has no more words to play (`j == len(b)`). If true, Alice wins, return `True`.\n        - Otherwise, see if the current word `b[j]` can be played. It must satisfy:\n            - Either `b[j]` has the same first letter as `w` and is greater than `w`.\n            - Or `b[j]` starts with a letter immediately following the first letter of `w`.\n        - If `b[j]` can be played, set `w = b[j]` and switch the turn (`k ^= 1`).\n        - If Bob can\u2019t play `b[j]`, increment `j` to check the next word in his list.\n\n    - **If it's Alice's turn (`k = 0`)**:\n        - Check if Alice has no more words to play (`i == len(a)`). If true, Bob wins, return `False`.\n        - Otherwise, see if the current word `a[i]` can be played. It must satisfy:\n            - Either `a[i]` has the same first letter as `w` and is greater than `w`.\n            - Or `a[i]` starts with a letter immediately following the first letter of `w`.\n        - If `a[i]` can be played, set `w = a[i]` and switch the turn (`k ^= 1`).\n        - If Alice can\u2019t play `a[i]`, increment `i` to check the next word in her list.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Lexicographical Order**: Understand the order in which words follow one another in a dictionary.\n- **Game Termination**: Carefully consider the game ending conditions for both players.\n- **Efficient Traversal**: Minimize the number of checks by making sure you only traverse each player's word list as necessary.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nConsider the example where `a = [\"ananas\", \"atlas\", \"banana\"]` and `b = [\"albatros\", \"cikla\", \"nogomet\"]`.\n1. Alice starts by playing `\"ananas\"`.\n2. Bob checks `b[0]=\"albatros\"`, but it\u2019s not greater than `\"ananas\"`.\n3. Bob has no valid words to play next, so Alice wins.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy maintaining and updating indices and the current word conditionally based on the rules of the game, you can effectively simulate the back-and-forth turns of the game. Careful attention to the lexicographic conditions and ensuring efficient use of indices will help you determine if Alice can indeed win the game.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def canAliceWin(self, a: List[str], b: List[str]) -> bool:\n        i, j, k = 1, 0, 1\n        w = a[0]\n        while 1:\n            if k:\n                if j == len(b):\n                    return True\n                if (b[j][0] == w[0] and b[j] > w) or ord(b[j][0]) - ord(w[0]) == 1:\n                    w = b[j]\n                    k ^= 1\n                j += 1\n            else:\n                if i == len(a):\n                    return False\n                if (a[i][0] == w[0] and a[i] > w) or ord(a[i][0]) - ord(w[0]) == 1:\n                    w = a[i]\n                    k ^= 1\n                i += 1\n", "problem_ids": ["the-wording-game"]}, "2812": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer n and an integer start.\nDefine an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2 * i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.\nReturn the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, start = 0\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.\nWhere \"^\" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, start = 3\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= start <= 1000\nn == nums.length\n\n Solution: \n## How to Solve the XOR Operation Problem: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIn this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to solve a problem involving the bitwise XOR operation on elements of an array. Let's break down the problem and tackle it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given two integers, `n` and `start`. Using these, you need to construct an array `nums` where each element is defined as follows:\n- `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (where `i` is the index of the element, starting from 0).\n\nFor instance, if `n = 5` and `start = 0`:\n- `nums` would be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n\nYour task is to return the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the `nums` array. \n\nBitwise XOR is a binary operation that follows these rules:\n- 0 XOR 0 = 0\n- 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nFollow the steps below to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize an Array to Store the Elements**: \n\n   Create an array `nums` where each element is calculated using the formula `nums[i] = start + 2 * i`. This array is defined for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Element**:\n\n   Iterate through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and calculate the value of `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Compute the XOR for All Elements**:\n\n   Initialize a variable to store the XOR result. As you iterate over the elements of the array, update this variable by XORing it with each element. This can be done using a loop.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Create the Array**:\n   - Declare an array called `nums` with a length of `n`.\n   - Loop from `0` to `n-1` to fill the array, where each element `nums[i]` is calculated as `start + 2 * i`.\n\n2. **Calculate XOR**:\n   - Initialize a variable, say `xor_result`, to `0`. This will store our final XOR result.\n   - Loop through the `nums` array and update `xor_result` by performing the XOR operation with each `nums[i]`. Essentially, `xor_result` becomes `xor_result ^ nums[i]` for each element `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, the variable `xor_result` will contain the final XOR result of all elements in the array.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's consider an example to make the explanation clearer.\n\n**Example 1**:\n- Input: `n = 5`, `start = 0`\n- Create the array `nums`:\n  - When `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 0 + 2 * 0 = 0`\n  - When `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2`\n  - When `i = 2`, `nums[2] = 0 + 2 * 2 = 4`\n  - When `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 0 + 2 * 3 = 6`\n  - When `i = 4`, `nums[4] = 0 + 2 * 4 = 8`\n- The array `nums` will be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n- Calculate the XOR of all elements:\n  - `result = 0 ^ 0 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 2 = 2`\n  - `result = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n  - `result = 6 ^ 6 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 8 = 8`\n- The final result is `8`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem and find the XOR of all elements in the `nums` array.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:\n        return reduce(xor, ((start + 2 * i) for i in range(n)))\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-operation-in-an-array"]}, "2816": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aba\"\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abca\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: You could delete the character 'c'.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"abc\"\nOutput: false\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n Solution: \nSure! Here is a step-by-step natural language guide to help a student solve the problem of determining whether a string can become a palindrome by deleting at most one character:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solving the Problem:\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nThe problem asks you to determine if a given string can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most one character. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as \"racecar\" or \"madam.\"\n\n#### Approach:\nThe goal is to use a two-pointer technique to efficiently check if the string can be made into a palindrome with at most one deletion.\n\n1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**\n   - Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the string. These pointers will be used to compare characters from both ends towards the middle.\n\n2. **Compare Characters:**\n   - Compare the characters at the positions of the two pointers.\n   - If the characters are the same, move the left pointer one step to the right and the right pointer one step to the left, and continue the comparison.\n\n3. **Handle Mismatches:**\n   - If the characters at the pointers do not match, you have two potential cases to handle:\n     1. **Skip the Character at the Left Pointer:** Check if the remaining substring (excluding the current character at the left pointer) can form a palindrome.\n     2. **Skip the Character at the Right Pointer:** Check if the remaining substring (excluding the current character at the right pointer) can form a palindrome.\n   - If either skipping the left character or the right character results in a palindrome, the answer is true.\n\n4. **Check Substrings:**\n   - To check if a substring is a palindrome, you can use a helper function or manual checks where you iterate through the substring using two pointers and compare characters from both ends towards the center.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - If you can adjust the string to form a palindrome by skipping at most one character, return true. Otherwise, return false.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\n**Example 1:** \n- Input: \"aba\"\n- Output: true\n- The string \"aba\" is already a palindrome, so no deletions are needed.\n\n**Example 2:** \n- Input: \"abca\"\n- Output: true\n- By removing the character 'c', the string becomes \"aba\", which is a palindrome.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: \"abc\"\n- Output: false\n- There is no way to remove just one character to make \"abc\" a palindrome.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- **Efficiency:** The two-pointer technique ensures that you only need to traverse the string up to twice (once for the full check and once for each potential skip), resulting in linear time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n- **Space Complexity:** You only need a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the possible recursive calls, resulting in O(1) space complexity.\n\nBy following these steps and using logic to handle mismatches and verify potential palindromes, you can solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:\n        def check(i, j):\n            while i < j:\n                if s[i] != s[j]:\n                    return False\n                i, j = i + 1, j - 1\n            return True\n\n        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n        while i < j:\n            if s[i] != s[j]:\n                return check(i, j - 1) or check(i + 1, j)\n            i, j = i + 1, j - 1\n        return True\n", "problem_ids": ["valid-palindrome-ii"]}, "2817": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:\n\n'?'

The input string `s`, containing only lowercase English letters.\n2. The pattern `p`, which can contain lowercase English letters, '?' and '*'.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the pattern `p` matches the entire input string `s`. Here\u2019s how the special characters work in the pattern:\n- `?` matches any single character.\n- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).\n\nFor example:\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"a\"` should return `false` because \"a\" does not match \"aa\".\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"*\"` should return `true` because '*' can match any sequence, including \"aa\".\n- `s = \"cb\", p = \"?a\"` should return `false` because although '?' matches 'c', 'a' does not match 'b'.\n\n#### Approach to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem effectively, you can use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - Design a function `dfs(i, j)` that will check if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` matches the substring of `p` starting from index `j`.\n   - The result would be stored in a cache to avoid recomputation.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `i` (the current position in `s`) is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, the function should return `True` only if `j` (the current position in `p`) is also at or beyond the end of `p`, or if the remaining characters in `p` are all '*'.\n   - If `j` is beyond the length of `p` but `i` isn't, return `False` since pattern `p` lacks more characters to match with `s`.\n\n3. **Handling '*' Character**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '*', check the following possibilities:\n     - The '*' matches zero characters \u2013 move to the next character in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i, j + 1)`).\n     - The '*' matches one or more characters \u2013 move to the next character in `s` but keep the current position in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j)`) or move to the next character in both `s` and `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n4. **Handling '?' Character or Exact Match**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '?' or the characters in `s` and `p` match, then move to the next characters in both the strings (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n5. **Memoization**:\n   - Use a caching mechanism to store the results of function calls to avoid redundant calculations. This will help in improving the efficiency drastically.\n\n6. **Final Check**:\n   - Begin the recursion from the start of both the strings (i.e., call `dfs(0, 0)`).\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\nYou can summarize the above logic into the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction isMatch(s, p):\n    memo = createEmptyCache()  # Initialize a cache to store results\n\n    Define function dfs(i, j):\n        if i >= length(s):\n            return j >= length(p) OR (p[j] == '*' AND func(i, j + 1))\n        if j >= length(p):\n            return False\n        if p[j] == '*':\n            return dfs(i + 1, j) OR dfs(i + 1, j + 1) OR dfs(i, j + 1)\n        return (p[j] == '?' OR s[i] == p[j]) AND dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n    return dfs(0, 0)\n\nCall isMatch with the strings s and p.\n```\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to construct a solution for the wildcard pattern matching problem by carefully defining and implementing the recursive function `dfs` with memoization. This will ensure you handle all possible pattern matching scenarios efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> bool:\n            if i >= len(s):\n                return j >= len(p) or (p[j] == \"*\" and dfs(i, j + 1))\n            if j >= len(p):\n                return False\n            if p[j] == \"*\":\n                return dfs(i + 1, j) or dfs(i + 1, j + 1) or dfs(i, j + 1)\n            return (p[j] == \"?\" or s[i] == p[j]) and dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n        return dfs(0, 0)\n", "problem_ids": ["wildcard-matching"]}, "2819": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)\n\nP   A   H   N\nA P L S I I G\nY   I   R\n\nAnd then read line by line: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\nWrite the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:\n\nstring convert(string s, int numRows);\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 3\nOutput: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4\nOutput: \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\nExplanation:\nP     I    N\nA   L S  I G\nY A   H R\nP     I\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"A\", numRows = 1\nOutput: \"A\"\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.\n1 <= numRows <= 1000\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Zigzag Pattern Conversion Problem\n\nTo solve the problem of converting a given string into a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows and then reading it line-by-line to form the final output, follow these detailed steps:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Understand the Zigzag Pattern:**\n   - The zigzag pattern involves writing characters in a diagonal fashion on a set number of rows and then reading the characters row-wise.\n   - For example, with the string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" and 3 rows, the pattern would look like this:\n     ```\n     P   A   H   N\n     A P L S I I G\n     Y   I   R\n     ```\n\n2. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the number of rows is 1, the output is the string itself because there is no zigzag pattern in a single row.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach:**\n   - Represent the zigzag structure using a list of lists (`g`). Each sublist will hold characters that belong to a specific row.\n   - Initialize variables:\n     - `i`: Tracks the current row index.\n     - `k`: A direction indicator (initially set to `-1` to represent upward movement).\n   - Traverse the string character by character. Append each character to the appropriate row in `g` based on the current value of `i`.\n\n4. **Direction Control:**\n   - Adjust the value of `i` and `k` to simulate the zigzag movement:\n     - If you are at the top row (`i == 0`) or the bottom row (`i == numRows - 1`), reverse the direction (`k = -k`).\n     - Update `i` by adding `k` (move up or down accordingly).\n\n5. **Collect the Result:**\n   - Once all characters have been added to the appropriate rows, concatenate all rows to form the final string by joining all sublists in `g`.\n\n#### Detailed Steps for Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a list of `numRows` empty lists (`g`).\n   - Set `i` to `0` (starting at the first row).\n   - Set `k` to `-1` (initial direction is upward).\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String:**\n   - For each character in the string:\n     - Append the character to the current row (`g[i]`).\n     - If you are at the first row (`i == 0`) or the last row (`i == numRows - 1`), multiply `k` by `-1` to change direction.\n     - Increment or decrement `i` by `k` to move to the next row accordingly.\n\n3. **Concatenate Rows:**\n   - After all characters are processed, each sublist in `g` contains the characters of a zigzag row.\n   - Combine all sublists into a single string and return this as the result.\n\n### Example to Clarify the Process\n\nLet's take an example to clarify:\n\n**Input:** `s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4`\n\n1. **Pattern Formation:**\n\n   ```\n   P     I    N\n   A   L S  I G\n   Y A   H R\n   P     I\n   ```\n\n2. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Initialize `g` with 4 empty lists.\n   - Traverse the string and distribute characters according to the zigzag pattern:\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 0.\n     - Traverse \"A\", add to row 1.\n     - Traverse \"Y\", add to row 2.\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 3 (Reverse direction here).\n     - Continue following the described rules.\n\n3. **Result Compilation:**\n   - After processing all characters, concatenate the rows:\n     ```\n     P + I + N + A + L + S + I + G + Y + A + H + R + P + I  => \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\n     ```\n   - Return the concatenated string as the final output.\n\n### Summary\nBy systematically simulating the zigzag pattern, updating row indices, and reversing direction at appropriate points, you can effectively convert the given string to the required format and compile the final output.

Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "2825": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two string arrays words1 and words2.\nA string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.\n\nFor example, \"wrr\" is a subset of \"warrior\" but is not a subset of \"world\".\n\nA string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.\nReturn an array of all the universal strings in words1.

Your task is to determine which words in `words1` are \"universal.\" A word from `words1` is considered universal if it contains all the letters in each word from `words2` with at least the same frequency.\n\nFor instance:\n- If `words2 = [\"e\",\"o\"]`, any universal word in `words1` must contain at least one 'e' and one 'o'.\n- If `words2 = [\"l\",\"e\"]`, any universal word in `words1` must contain at least one 'l' and one 'e'.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n1. **Count the Maximum Frequency of Each Letter in Words2:**\n    - Create a frequency dictionary (`cnt`), which tracks the maximum frequency of each letter required by any word in `words2`.\n    - For each word in `words2`, count the frequency of each letter.\n    - Update the frequency dictionary to ensure it records the highest frequency for each letter found across all words in `words2`.\n\n2. **Check Each Word in Words1:**\n    - For each word in `words1`, count the frequency of each letter.\n    - Compare this frequency with the frequency dictionary (`cnt`). If the word from `words1` meets or exceeds the required frequencies for all letters specified in `cnt`, it is considered a universal word.\n\n3. **Collect and Return the Universal Words:**\n    - Make a list of all words from `words1` that are determined to be universal based on the above checks.\n    - Return this list.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Frequency Dictionary:**\n    - Use an empty dictionary or a `Counter` to keep track of the maximum frequency of each letter required by any of the words in `words2`.\n\n2. **Update Frequency Dictionary:**\n    - Loop through each word in `words2`.\n    - For each word, loop through its letters and count their occurrences.\n    - For each letter in the word, update the frequency dictionary to store the highest frequency encountered for that letter.\n\n3. **Frequency Comparison for Words1:**\n    - Create an empty list to store the universal words.\n    - Loop through each word in `words1`.\n    - For each word, count the frequency of its letters.\n    - Check if this word contains each letter in frequencies that meet or exceed those in the frequency dictionary (`cnt`).\n    - If it does, add this word to the list of universal words.\n\n4. **Return the Result:**\n    - Return the list of all universal words found.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's walk through an example to make it clearer:\n\n- **Example Input:**\n    ```python\n    words1 = [\"amazon\", \"apple\", \"facebook\", \"google\", \"leetcode\"]\n    words2 = [\"e\", \"o\"]\n    ```\n\n- **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n    **Step 1: Initialize the Frequency Dictionary**\n    - For words2 = [\"e\", \"o\"]:\n        - \"e\" contributes: {'e': 1}\n        - \"o\" contributes: {'o': 1}\n        \n    Thus, `cnt = {'e': 1, 'o': 1}`.\n\n    **Step 2: Compare Words from words1:**\n    - For \"amazon\":\n        - Count of letters: {'a': 2, 'm': 1, 'z': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1}\n        - 'e' frequency (1 needed, 0 found) => Not universal.\n    - For \"apple\":\n        - Count of letters: {'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}\n        - 'o' frequency (1 needed, 0 found) => Not universal.\n    - For \"facebook\":\n        - Count of letters: {'f': 1, 'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'e': 2, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'k': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n    - For \"google\":\n        - Count of letters: {'g': 2, 'o': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n    - For \"leetcode\":\n        - Count of letters: {'l': 1, 'e': 3, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'o': 1, 'd': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n\n    Therefore, the universal words are `[\"facebook\", \"google\", \"leetcode\"]`.\n\n#### Summary:\n- Use a frequency dictionary to track the highest letter frequency required by any word in `words2`.\n- Check each word in `words1` against this frequency dictionary.\n- Collect and return all words from `words1` that meet the letter frequency requirements.\n\nFollow these steps, and you should be able to determine the universal words efficiently.

Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]\nOutput: [false,false,false,false,false]\nExplanation: Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.\nPlease notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 104\n0 <= threshold <= n\n1 <= queries.length <= 105\nqueries[i].length == 2\n1 <= ai, bi <= cities\nai != bi\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Problem Using Union-Find\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\nYou are given `n` cities labeled from 1 to `n`. Cities are connected by a road if they share a common divisor greater than a given `threshold`. You need to determine if pairs of cities from a list of queries are connected, either directly or indirectly through other cities.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Union-Find Data Structure:**\n    - To efficiently manage city connections and determine whether two cities are in the same connected component, you will use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure.\n\n2. **Initialization:**\n    - Initialize your Union-Find structure for `n+1` elements because city labels range from 1 to `n`.\n\n3. **Connect Cities via Common Divisors:**\n    - Iterate over each integer `z` from `threshold + 1` to `n`. For each `z`, mark it and its multiples as part of the same connected component.\n    - This can be done by union-ing `z` with its multiples up to `n` (i.e., `z, 2z, 3z,...`).\n\n4. **Handling the Queries:**\n    - For each query `(a, b)`, use the find operation from the Union-Find structure to check if `a` and `b` belong to the same component.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Union-Find Class Implementation:**\n    - Create a Union-Find class with methods:\n        - `find(x)`: Determine which subset a particular element is in.\n        - `union(a, b)`: Join two subsets into a single subset.\n        \n2. **Initialize Union-Find:**\n   - Initialize the parent (`p`) array where each element is its own parent initially.\n   - Initialize a size (`size`) array to keep track of the size of each set for union by size optimization.\n\n3. **Union-Find with Multiples:**\n    - For every integer `z` starting from `threshold + 1` to `n`, perform the following:\n        - For each multiple of `z` (i.e., `2z, 3z,...` up to `n`), union `z` with its multiple.\n        \n4. **Check Connectivity in Queries:**\n    - For each query `(a, b)`, check if the result of `find(a)` equals the result of `find(b)`.\n    - If they are equal, it means both cities are in the same connected component, i.e., they are connected either directly or indirectly.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nConsider `n = 6`, `threshold = 2`, and `queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]`.\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n    - Initialize Union-Find for 7 elements (0 to 6).\n\n2. **Connecting Cities:**\n    - For `z = 3` (since `threshold + 1 = 3`):\n        - Union(3, 6) because 6 is a multiple of 3.\n    - Resulting internal state shows that 3 and 6 are in the same set.\n\n3. **Query Processing:**\n    - For query [1, 4], 1 and 4 are not connected.\n    - For query [2, 5], 2 and 5 are not connected.\n    - For query [3, 6], 3 and 6 are connected.\n\n#### Final Output\n\nBased on the above processing, the output for the given queries will be `[false, false, true]`.\n\n#### Optimizations and Complexity\n\n1. **Time Complexity:**\n    - Building connections involves `O(n log n)` operations due to iterating through each number and its multiples.\n    - Each query involves `O(alpha(n))` time due to the almost constant time complexity of the find and union operations.\n\n2. **Space Complexity:**\n    - Uses `O(n)` space to store parent and size arrays.\n\nUsing this detailed guide, you should be able to implement the solution and understand how Union-Find helps efficiently manage connected components.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass UnionFind:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.p = list(range(n))\n        self.size = [1] * n\n\n    def find(self, x):\n        if self.p[x] != x:\n            self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])\n        return self.p[x]\n\n    def union(self, a, b):\n        pa, pb = self.find(a), self.find(b)\n        if pa == pb:\n            return False\n        if self.size[pa] > self.size[pb]:\n            self.p[pb] = pa\n            self.size[pa] += self.size[pb]\n        else:\n            self.p[pa] = pb\n            self.size[pb] += self.size[pa]\n        return True\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def areConnected(\n        self, n: int, threshold: int, queries: List[List[int]]\n    ) -> List[bool]:\n        uf = UnionFind(n + 1)\n        for a in range(threshold + 1, n + 1):\n            for b in range(a + a, n + 1, a):\n                uf.union(a, b)\n        return [uf.find(a) == uf.find(b) for a, b in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["graph-connectivity-with-threshold"]}, "2828": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\nThe initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\nIf more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    \nIncrease the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.\n        \nFor example, say you start with the words [\"abcdef\",\"abndef\"] both initially abbreviated as \"a4f\".

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "2831": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.\nPartition the cards into one or more groups such that:\n\nEach group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and\nAll the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.\n\nReturn true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: No possible partition.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= deck.length <= 104\n0 <= deck[i] < 104\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "2832": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array nums and an integer x.

You can remove elements from either the beginning or the end of the array and subtract their values from \\( x \\). You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce \\( x \\) to exactly zero. If it is not possible, return \\(-1\\).\n\n### Approach to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we use a combination of prefix sums and a hash table to track the longest subarray with a certain sum. Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. **Transform the Problem:** Instead of directly removing elements from both ends and trying to reduce \\( x \\), think of the problem as finding a subarray in \\( nums \\) where the sum of the subarray is equal to the total sum of \\( nums \\) minus \\( x \\). This way, reducing \\( x \\) to zero can be rephrased as removing all elements that are not part of this subarray.\n\n2. **Calculate the Target Sum:** Compute the target sum \\( s \\) that the subarray needs to achieve. This sum is the total sum of the array minus \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\text{sum}(nums) - x\n   \\]\n   If \\( s \\) is negative, it's not possible to reduce \\( x \\) to zero, and you should return \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Setup a Hash Table:** Utilize a hash table to record the prefix sums. The prefix sum up to index \\( i \\) is the sum of all elements from the start of the array to \\( i \\). Initially, set a prefix sum of zero at index \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{vis} = \\{0: -1\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Traverse the Array:** Iterate through the array while computing the current prefix sum. For each element in \\( nums \\):\n   - Add the element to the current prefix sum.\n   - Check if the prefix sum needed to achieve the target sum exists in the hash table.\n   - If it exists, update the length of the longest subarray.\n   - Add the current prefix sum and its index to the hash table if it does not exist.\n\n5. **Update the Maximum Length:** Keep track of the maximum length of the subarray with the sum \\( s \\). Update it whenever you find a valid subarray sum.\n\n6. **Determine the Result:** After processing the entire array, if you haven't found any valid subarray, return \\(-1\\). Otherwise, the minimum number of operations to reduce \\( x \\) to zero would be the total length of the array minus the length of this subarray.\n\n### Step-by-Step Example:\n\nLet's work through an example to make things clearer:\n   - **Example 1:**\n     - Input: `nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3], x = 5`\n     - Compute `s = sum(nums) - x = 11 - 5 = 6`\n     - Traverse the array while maintaining the prefix sum and update the hash table.\n       - Prefix sums: `1, 2, 6, 8, 11`\n       - Hash table updates: `{0: -1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 6: 2, 8: 3, 11: 4}`\n       - Check for prefix sums needed to achieve `s`: \n         - When prefix sum (6) is achieved at index 2, the subarray `[1, 1, 4]` sums to 6.\n     - `mx` gets updated to 3, resulting in `len(nums) - mx = 5 - 3 = 2`.\n     - Output: 2\n\n### Conclusion\nBy transforming the problem into finding a subarray with a specific sum, you reduce the complexity and make it possible to solve it more efficiently using a hash table and prefix sums. This approach ensures that you are computing the result in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs.\n\nBy following these steps methodically, you should be able to solve the problem without directly writing the solution code initially.

Here's a step-by-step natural language guide to help you solve the problem of finding the longest harmonious subsequence in an integer array:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - You need to find the longest harmonious subsequence in an integer array. A harmonious array is one where the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value is exactly 1.\n   - A subsequence is a sequence derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n2. **Example Analysis:**\n   - For example, in the array `[1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7]`, the longest harmonious subsequence is `[3, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, which has a length of 5.\n   - In the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the longest harmonious subsequence is `[1, 2]` or `[2, 3]` or `[3, 4]`, each with a length of 2.\n   - When all elements are the same, like in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, you cannot form a harmonious subsequence because the difference between the maximum and minimum is not 1.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Use a hash table (dictionary) to count the occurrences of each element in the array.\n   - Iterate over each element in the hash table to check if there exists an element that is exactly 1 more than the current element.\n   - If such an element exists, calculate the sum of the counts of the current element and the element that is 1 more.\n   - Keep track of the maximum sum encountered, as this represents the longest harmonious subsequence.\n\n4. **Steps to Implement the Solution:**\n   - **Create a hash table**: Use a dictionary to store the count of each element in the array.\n   - **Count occurrences**: Traverse the array and populate the dictionary with the count of each number.\n   - **Find pairs**: For each unique number in the dictionary, check if the number +1 exists in the dictionary.\n   - **Calculate lengths**: If the number +1 exists, add the counts of the current number and the number +1, and update a variable to store the maximum sum found.\n   - **Return the result**: The variable with the maximum sum represents the length of the longest harmonious subsequence.\n\n5. **Details to Consider:**\n   - Make sure you handle the case where no harmonious subsequences can be formed (e.g., when all elements are the same).\n   - Be efficient with counting by using a hash table to keep track of occurrences, as this ensures that you can find results in linear time relative to the size of the array.\n\n6. **Example Workflow:**\n   - Given the array `[1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7]`:\n     - Create a dictionary to count occurrences: `{1: 1, 3: 2, 2: 3, 5: 1, 7: 1}`\n     - Iterate over the keys in the dictionary:\n       - For key `1`: Check if `2` exists.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you solve the given coding problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Room Allocation Problem\n\n#### 1. Understand the Problem:\nYou have `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n-1` and a list of meetings. Each meeting has an original start time, and you need to allocate rooms in such a way that minimizes delays. If all rooms are occupied, meetings should be delayed but keep their duration. You need to determine which room hosts the most meetings, and in case of a tie, return the room with the smallest number.\n\n#### 2. Data Structures to Use:\n- **Min-Heaps (Priority Queues)**:\n  - **Idle Rooms Min-Heap**: Stores idle rooms by their index, ensuring you can quickly get the room with the lowest number.\n  - **Busy Rooms Min-Heap**: Stores busy rooms by their end times and room indexes, allowing you to efficiently find the room that's going to be free the soonest.\n\n- **Counts Array**: An array to keep track of how many meetings each room hosts.\n\n#### 3. Sort Meetings:\nSort the meetings array based on start times to process them in chronological order.\n\n#### 4. Process Each Meeting:\nFor each meeting:\n- **Freeing Up Rooms**: Check the busy rooms heap. If the meeting with the earliest end time is completed (i.e., its end time is less than or equal to the current meeting's start time), move those rooms back to the idle rooms heap.\n- **Allocating Rooms**:\n  - **If Idle Rooms Available**: Pop the smallest indexed room from the idle rooms heap and mark it as busy until the end of the current meeting.\n  - **If No Idle Rooms Available**: Pop the room from the busy heap that will be free the soonest, delay the start of this meeting to align with the end time of this room's current meeting, then push it back into the busy heap with the new end time.\n\n#### 5. Track Meetings Count:\nEvery time a room gets a meeting allocated, increment its count in the counts array.\n\n#### 6. Determine the Result:\nAfter processing all meetings, iterate over the counts array to find the room with the highest count. If there is a tie, pick the room with the smallest number.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Initialize Heaps**:\n   - Create an empty list for busy rooms.\n   - Create a list of idle rooms initialized with room indexes from `0` to `n-1` and convert it to a heap.\n   - Create a counts array of size `n` initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **Sort the Meetings**:\n   - Sort the meetings list based on start times.\n\n3. **Process Each Meeting**:\n   - For each meeting `[start, end]`:\n     - Move rooms from the busy heap to the idle heap if their end time is less than or equal to the current meeting's start time.\n     - If there are idle rooms:\n       - Pop the smallest room index from the idle heap, increment its meeting count, and push it to the busy heap with its end time.\n     - If there are no idle rooms:\n       - Pop the room that will be free the soonest from the busy heap, delay the meeting, increment its count, and push it back to the busy heap with the new end time.\n\n4. **Determine the Room with Most Meetings**:\n   - Initialize a variable to store the index of the room with the maximum meetings.\n   - Iterate through the counts array to find the index with the maximum value.\n   - Return this index.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to determine which room has hosted the most meetings while handling delays and room allocation efficiently using heaps.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        meetings.sort()\n        busy = []\n        idle = list(range(n))\n        heapify(idle)\n        cnt = [0] * n\n        for s, e in meetings:\n            while busy and busy[0][0] <= s:\n                heappush(idle, heappop(busy)[1])\n            if idle:\n                i = heappop(idle)\n                cnt[i] += 1\n                heappush(busy, (e, i))\n            else:\n                a, i = heappop(busy)\n                cnt[i] += 1\n                heappush(busy, (a + e - s, i))\n        ans = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(cnt):\n            if cnt[ans] < v:\n                ans = i\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["meeting-rooms-iii"]}, "2837": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed\u00a0integer array nums.\nWe say that an integer x is expressible from nums if there exist some integers 0 <= index1 < index2 < ... < indexk < nums.length for which nums[index1] | nums[index2] | ... | nums[indexk] = x.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you approach and solve this problem:\n\n#### Understanding the Problem\n1. **Bitwise OR:** This operation sets each bit to 1 if one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. For example, `2 (10 in binary)` OR `1 (01 in binary)` equals `3 (11 in binary)`.\n2. **Subsequence:** Any sequence derived by deleting some or no elements of an array without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n3. **Expressible Integer:** An integer `x` is considered expressible if it can be produced by applying the bitwise OR operation on some subsequence of the array `nums`.\n\n#### Strategic Approach\n1. **Initial Observation:** Start by observing that the smallest expressible numbers can include `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, etc., if they are directly present in the array. If some numbers can be formed by OR operations of existing numbers in the array, they'll also be expressible.\n2. **Enumerate the Powers of 2:** Iterate through powers of 2 starting from `1 (2^0)`, `2 (2^1)`, `4 (2^2)`, and so on. Check if each of these numbers is present in the array `nums` or can be expressed by its subsequences.\n3. **First Missing Power of 2:** The first power of 2 that is not in the set of numbers from the array `nums` is the smallest integer that cannot be expressed using any subsequence of the array.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n1. **Extract Information:**\n   - Capture the elements of the array `nums`.\n   - Identify important constraints (e.g., size of the array and range of values).\n\n2. **Set Representation:**\n   - Convert the array `nums` into a set for efficient membership checking. This conversion allows you to quickly determine if a number is in `nums`.\n\n3. **Iteration over Powers of 2:**\n   - Enumerate powers from `2^0` up to a reasonable limit (commonly up to `2^31` due to constraints).\n   - For each power of 2, check if it is present in the set of elements from `nums`.\n\n4. **Identify the Missing Integer:**\n   - The first power of 2 that isn't present in `nums` is the result, i.e., the smallest integer that cannot be expressed by any subsequence of `nums`.\n\n#### Implementation Outline\n- Create a set from the array `nums`.\n- Use a loop to check each power of 2 (starting from 1).\n- Return upon finding the first power of 2 that is not present in the set.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\nConsider `nums = [2, 1]`:\n1. Convert `nums` to a set: `s = {1, 2}`.\n2. Enumerate powers of 2:\n   - `2^0 = 1` is in `s`.\n   - `2^1 = 2` is in `s`.\n   - `2^2 = 4` is not in `s`, so `4` is the answer.\n\nFor `nums = [5, 3, 2]`:\n1. Convert `nums` to a set: `s = {2, 3, 5}`.\n2. Enumerate powers of 2:\n   - `2^0 = 1` is not in the set `s`, so `1` is the answer.\n\n#### Key Points\n- Using a set for quick membership checking is crucial.\n- Iterating through possible powers of 2 methodically ensures efficiency.\n- The stopping criteria is finding the first power of 2 not present in the set.\n\nBy following this guide, you should be able to deduce and implement a solution to determine the smallest positive integer that cannot be formed by any subsequence of the given array using bitwise OR operations.

Let's walk through a detailed guide on solving this problem.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\nYou are given an array `heights` that represents the heights of buildings and an array of `queries` where each query contains two indices `[a, b]` indicating the initial positions of Alice and Bob. The goal is to determine the leftmost building index where both Alice and Bob can meet. \n\nThe specific rules for moving are:\n1. Alice and Bob can only move to buildings with a higher index.\n2. They can only move to buildings that are taller than their current building.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:\n   - **Input**: `heights` (array of positive integers) and `queries` (array of pairs).\n   - **Output**: An array where each element represents the smallest index of a building where Alice and Bob can meet according to the constraints.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - If Alice and Bob start in the same building, they trivially meet there.\n   - If `heights[a] < heights[b]`, Bob can move directly to `b` or further if possible.\n   - For more complex cases, we need to discover the smallest building index they can both reach.\n\n3. **Efficient Solution Approach**:\n   - **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**:\n     - Since we need to efficiently update and query the smallest index where certain conditions are satisfied, a BIT can be useful.\n     - The BIT will help us maintain the minimum indices of buildings that satisfy the height constraints.\n\n4. **Detailed Implementation Steps**:\n   - **Sort Queries**: Sort the queries based on the second index `b` in descending order.\n   - **Initialize BIT**: Create and initialize a BIT to handle our index and height conditions.\n   - **Discretize Heights**: Since heights can be very large, discretize them by mapping each unique height to a smaller range.\n   - **Process Queries**:\n     - Traverse each query in the sorted order.\n     - Keep updating the BIT with indices and corresponding heights as you process the buildings.\n     - For each query, determine if Alice and Bob can meet at the given index or find the smallest index using the BIT.\n\n5. **Edge Cases Handling**:\n   - Handle cases where Alice and Bob start at the same building directly.\n   - Consider the constraints to ensure efficient computation even for large inputs.\n\n### Implementation Outline:\n   \n1. **Discretization**: Use sorting and binary search (`bisect_left` in Python) to handle the heights efficiently.\n\n2. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) Operations**:\n   - **Update** operation to register a new building index.\n   - **Query** operation to find the minimum index satisfying our conditions.\n\n3. **Simultaneous Processing**:\n   - Loop through the buildings and update the BIT.\n   - For each query, use the BIT to check and update answers accordingly.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nFor `heights = [5,3,8,2,6,1,4,6]` and `queries = [[0,7],[3,5],[5,2],[3,0],[1,6]]`:\n\n1. Start by sorting the queries.\n2. Initialize a BIT and start processing from the end of the `heights` array.\n3. Update BIT with each building as you process it.\n4. For each query:\n   - If Alice and Bob can meet directly at `b`, update result.\n   - Else, use BIT to find the appropriate meeting point.\n\nBy consistently updating and querying the BIT, and leveraging discreet intervals for heights, the problem can be solved efficiently even with high constraints.\n\nWith this structured approach, you should be able to implement the solution systematically and handle the inputs within the given constraints.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass BinaryIndexedTree:\n    __slots__ = [\"n\", \"c\"]\n\n    def __init__(self, n: int):\n        self.n = n\n        self.c = [inf] * (n + 1)\n\n    def update(self, x: int, v: int):\n        while x <= self.n:\n            self.c[x] = min(self.c[x], v)\n            x += x & -x\n\n    def query(self, x: int) -> int:\n        mi = inf\n        while x:\n            mi = min(mi, self.c[x])\n            x -= x & -x\n        return -1 if mi == inf else mi\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def leftmostBuildingQueries(\n        self, heights: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]\n    ) -> List[int]:\n        n, m = len(heights), len(queries)\n        for i in range(m):\n            queries[i] = [min(queries[i]), max(queries[i])]\n        j = n - 1\n        s = sorted(set(heights))\n        ans = [-1] * m\n        tree = BinaryIndexedTree(n)\n        for i in sorted(range(m), key=lambda i: -queries[i][1]):\n            l, r = queries[i]\n            while j > r:\n                k = n - bisect_left(s, heights[j]) + 1\n                tree.update(k, j)\n                j -= 1\n            if l == r or heights[l] < heights[r]:\n                ans[i] = r\n            else:\n                k = n - bisect_left(s, heights[l])\n                ans[i] = tree.query(k)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["find-building-where-alice-and-bob-can-meet"]}, "2844": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.\n\nFor example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.\n\nGiven an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.\u00a0\nNote: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.\nAn array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [3] has an XOR total of 3.\n- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.\n0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,1,6]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [5] has an XOR total of 5.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [6] has an XOR total of 6.\n- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.\n- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.\n- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.\n- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.\n0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]\nOutput: 480\nExplanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 12\n1 <= nums[i] <= 20\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through how to solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe need to compute the sum of all XOR totals for every possible subset of a given array `nums`. XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares each bit of its operands. For instance, the XOR of 2 (0010 in binary) and 5 (0101 in binary) is 7 (0111 in binary).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Represent Subsets Using Binary Numbers\n- Each subset of an array can be represented by a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included in the subset (1) or not (0).\n- For example, an array `[a, b, c]` has its subsets represented by:\n  - `000` (empty subset)\n  - `001` (subset with only `c`)\n  - `010` (subset with only `b`)\n  - `011` (subset with `b` and `c`)\n  - and so on.\n\n#### 2. Enumerate All Subsets\n- You can enumerate all subsets by considering all binary numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. In binary form, each number in this range corresponds to a subset.\n\n#### 3. Calculate XOR for Each Subset\n- For each subset represented by binary number `i`, check each bit position. Include the element in the subset if the bit is `1`.\n- Compute the XOR for all included elements.\n\n#### 4. Sum All XOR Results\n- Maintain a running total of the XOR results from all subsets. \n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Create a variable to store the total sum of all XOR results.\n\n2. **Loop Through All Possible Subsets:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through all integers from `0` to `2^n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Each Element:**\n   - For each subset, check each bit of the current integer:\n     - If the bit at position `j` is `1`, include the `j`-th element of `nums` in the subset.\n\n4. **Compute XOR for the Current Subset:**\n   - Initialize a variable for the current XOR total. For each `1` bit found, XOR it with the current total.\n\n5. **Add the XOR Result to Total:**\n   - After computing the XOR for the current subset, add it to the running total.\n\n6. **Return the Total Sum:**\n   - Once all subsets are processed, return the running total.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's say the array is `[1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `total_sum = 0`\n\n2. **Generate Subsets:**\n   - The length `n = 2`, so iterate over `i` from `0` to `3` (`2^2 - 1`).\n\n3. **Subset by `i = 0` (`00` in binary):**\n   - No elements included. XOR total = `0`.\n   - Add `0` to `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Subset by `i = 1` (`01` in binary):**\n   - Include element `1`. XOR total = `1`.\n   - Add `1` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 1`.\n\n5. **Subset by `i = 2` (`10` in binary):**\n   - Include element `3`. XOR total = `3`.\n   - Add `3` to `total_sum`.

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "2847": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two string arrays words1 and words2.\nA string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.\n\nFor example, \"wrr\" is a subset of \"warrior\" but is not a subset of \"world\".\n\nA string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.\nReturn an array of all the universal strings in words1.

Your task is to determine which words in `words1` are \"universal.\" A word from `words1` is considered universal if it contains all the letters in each word from `words2` with at least the same frequency.\n\nFor instance:\n- If `words2 = [\"e\",\"o\"]`, any universal word in `words1` must contain at least one 'e' and one 'o'.\n- If `words2 = [\"l\",\"e\"]`, any universal word in `words1` must contain at least one 'l' and one 'e'.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n1. **Count the Maximum Frequency of Each Letter in Words2:**\n    - Create a frequency dictionary (`cnt`), which tracks the maximum frequency of each letter required by any word in `words2`.\n    - For each word in `words2`, count the frequency of each letter.\n    - Update the frequency dictionary to ensure it records the highest frequency for each letter found across all words in `words2`.\n\n2. **Check Each Word in Words1:**\n    - For each word in `words1`, count the frequency of each letter.\n    - Compare this frequency with the frequency dictionary (`cnt`). If the word from `words1` meets or exceeds the required frequencies for all letters specified in `cnt`, it is considered a universal word.\n\n3. **Collect and Return the Universal Words:**\n    - Make a list of all words from `words1` that are determined to be universal based on the above checks.\n    - Return this list.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Frequency Dictionary:**\n    - Use an empty dictionary or a `Counter` to keep track of the maximum frequency of each letter required by any of the words in `words2`.\n\n2. **Update Frequency Dictionary:**\n    - Loop through each word in `words2`.\n    - For each word, loop through its letters and count their occurrences.\n    - For each letter in the word, update the frequency dictionary to store the highest frequency encountered for that letter.\n\n3. **Frequency Comparison for Words1:**\n    - Create an empty list to store the universal words.\n    - Loop through each word in `words1`.\n    - For each word, count the frequency of its letters.\n    - Check if this word contains each letter in frequencies that meet or exceed those in the frequency dictionary (`cnt`).\n    - If it does, add this word to the list of universal words.\n\n4. **Return the Result:**\n    - Return the list of all universal words found.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's walk through an example to make it clearer:\n\n- **Example Input:**\n    ```python\n    words1 = [\"amazon\", \"apple\", \"facebook\", \"google\", \"leetcode\"]\n    words2 = [\"e\", \"o\"]\n    ```\n\n- **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n    **Step 1: Initialize the Frequency Dictionary**\n    - For words2 = [\"e\", \"o\"]:\n        - \"e\" contributes: {'e': 1}\n        - \"o\" contributes: {'o': 1}\n        \n    Thus, `cnt = {'e': 1, 'o': 1}`.\n\n    **Step 2: Compare Words from words1:**\n    - For \"amazon\":\n        - Count of letters: {'a': 2, 'm': 1, 'z': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1}\n        - 'e' frequency (1 needed, 0 found) => Not universal.\n    - For \"apple\":\n        - Count of letters: {'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}\n        - 'o' frequency (1 needed, 0 found) => Not universal.\n    - For \"facebook\":\n        - Count of letters: {'f': 1, 'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'e': 2, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'k': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n    - For \"google\":\n        - Count of letters: {'g': 2, 'o': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n    - For \"leetcode\":\n        - Count of letters: {'l': 1, 'e': 3, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'o': 1, 'd': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n\n    Therefore, the universal words are `[\"facebook\", \"google\", \"leetcode\"]`.\n\n#### Summary:\n- Use a frequency dictionary to track the highest letter frequency required by any word in `words2`.\n- Check each word in `words1` against this frequency dictionary.\n- Collect and return all words from `words1` that meet the letter frequency requirements.\n\nFollow these steps, and you should be able to determine the universal words efficiently.

Your goal is to figure out the minimum number of these stickers you need to spell out a given target string by cutting out individual letters from the stickers and rearranging them. Each sticker can be used an infinite number of times.\n\n#### Step 2: Problem Constraints\n1. The number of stickers, \\( n \\), is between 1 and 50.\n2. Each sticker's word length is between 1 and 10 characters.\n3. The target string length is between 1 and 15 characters.\n4. All stickers and the target string consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n#### Step 3: Key Insight - State Representation\nGiven the small length of the target string (max 15 characters), we can represent the state of completion for the target string using a binary number:\n- A bit at position \\( i \\) in the binary number represents whether the \\( i \\)-th character of the target string has been spelled out.\n- If the bit is 1, it means the character at position \\( i \\) has been spelled out.\n- If the bit is 0, it means the character at position \\( i \\) has not been spelled out.\n\n#### Step 4: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS)\nWe'll approach the problem using BFS because it efficiently explores all possible ways to spell the target string to find the minimum number of steps:\n1. **Initial State**: Start with all bits as 0, meaning no characters of the target have been spelled out.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of states to be explored, starting from the initial state (0).\n3. **Visited States**: Use an array to mark visited states to avoid re-exploring them.\n\n#### Step 5: Mapping Stickers to Target Characters\nFor each state, try to use each sticker to spell out more characters of the target string:\n1. Convert the sticker into a frequency count of its characters.\n2. For each unspelled character in the target string, try to spell it using the current sticker.\n3. Update the state accordingly by setting the appropriate bits to 1.\n\n#### Step 6: Transition Between States\nFor every state in our BFS:\n1. Dequeue the current state.\n2. Check if this state corresponds to all bits being 1 (i.e., the target is spelled out completely). If so, return the number of steps (stickers used).\n3. For each sticker, calculate the new state by attempting to use its characters to spell more of the target string.\n4. If the new state hasn\u2019t been visited before, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n\n#### Step 7: Implement BFS Logic\n1. Initialize your queue with the starting state.\n2. Use a loop (while queue is not empty) to explore each state.\n3. For each state, iterate over all stickers to compute possible new states.\n4. Track the number of stickers used in the process.\n5. Return the minimum number of stickers when the target is spelled out (all bits set to 1), or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nThis high-level algorithm should help you understand how to approach the problem and implement a solution using BFS, state compression, and bit manipulation techniques. Remember, the BFS ensures that the first time you reach the final state where the target string can be completely spelled out, you have achieved it using the minimum number of stickers.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minStickers(self, stickers: List[str], target: str) -> int:\n        n = len(target)\n        q = deque([0])\n        vis = [False] * (1 << n)\n        vis[0] = True\n        ans = 0\n        while q:\n            for _ in range(len(q)):\n                cur = q.popleft()\n                if cur == (1 << n) - 1:\n                    return ans\n                for s in stickers:\n                    cnt = Counter(s)\n                    nxt = cur\n                    for i, c in enumerate(target):\n                        if (cur >> i & 1) == 0 and cnt[c] > 0:\n                            cnt[c] -= 1\n                            nxt |= 1 << i\n                    if not vis[nxt]:\n                        vis[nxt] = True\n                        q.append(nxt)\n            ans += 1\n        return -1\n", "problem_ids": ["stickers-to-spell-word"]}, "2849": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time.

Negative `freq[i]` indicates removal.\n- Use a max-heap efficiently by pushing negative values for the counts.\n- Implement lazy deletion to efficiently manage the removal of outdated frequency counts from the priority queue.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to solve the problem effectively!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def mostFrequentIDs(self, nums: List[int], freq: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        cnt = Counter()\n        lazy = Counter()\n        ans = []\n        pq = []\n        for x, f in zip(nums, freq):\n            lazy[cnt[x]] += 1\n            cnt[x] += f\n            heappush(pq, -cnt[x])\n            while pq and lazy[-pq[0]] > 0:\n                lazy[-pq[0]] -= 1\n                heappop(pq)\n            ans.append(0 if not pq else -pq[0])\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["most-frequent-ids"]}, "2850": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.\nSplit the array into one or more disjoint subarrays such that:\n\nEach element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray, and\nThe GCD of the elements of each subarray is strictly greater than 1.\n\nReturn the minimum number of subarrays that can be obtained after the split.\nNote that:\n\nThe GCD of a subarray is the largest positive integer that evenly divides all the elements of the subarray.\nA subarray is a contiguous part of the array.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [12,6,3,14,8]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can split the array into the subarrays: [12,6,3] and [14,8].\n- The GCD of 12, 6 and 3 is 3, which is strictly greater than 1.\n- The GCD of 14 and 8 is 2, which is strictly greater than 1.\nIt can be shown that splitting the array into one subarray will make the GCD = 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,12,6,14]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can split the array into only one subarray, which is the whole array.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 2000\n2 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n Solution: \nSure! Here's a detailed guide to help you solve the problem of splitting an array into subarrays such that the GCD of each subarray is strictly greater than 1. We'll take you through each step to build an understanding of how you might construct a solution.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given an array of positive integers, and you need to split this array into one or more subarrays. The goal is to ensure that:\n1. Every element in the original array is placed in exactly one subarray.\n2. The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all elements within each subarray is strictly greater than 1.\n\nYour task is to figure out the minimum number of such subarrays.\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n#### 1. Initializing Variables\n\nStart by initializing two variables:\n- `g` (to track the GCD of the current subarray): Initially set to 0.\n- `ans` (to count the number of subarrays): Initially set to 1.\n\n#### 2. Traversing the Array\n\nYou will iterate through each element `x` in the array `nums`. For each element, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n##### Maintaining the GCD\n\nUse the `gcd` function to calculate the GCD of the current subarray `g` and the current element `x`. This will help you decide if the current element can be part of the existing subarray or if it needs to start a new subarray.\n\n##### Checking for GCD of 1\n\nIf the GCD of `g` and `x` is 1, this means that there is no common divisor greater than 1 between them, and thus they cannot be in the same subarray. In this case:\n- Increment your `ans` by 1 since you'll need a new subarray.\n- Update `g` to `x` because `x` starts a new subarray.\n\nIf the GCD is greater than 1, continue adding elements to the current subarray. \n\n#### 3. Continue Until End of Array\n\nRepeat the above steps for all elements in the `nums` array.\n\n### Key Functions\n\nTo implement this solution, you'll primarily rely on the GCD calculation. Most programming languages have a built-in function for computing the GCD of two numbers (for instance, Python\u2019s `math.gcd` function).\n\n### Final Thought\n\nThe steps outlined ensure you track when to start a new subarray based on the GCD condition and therefore efficiently determine the minimum number of subarrays required. The overall computational complexity is quite manageable given the problem constraints.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's take the first example to clarify:\n\n```plaintext\nInput: nums = [12, 6, 3, 14, 8]\n```\n\n- Start with `g = 0` and `ans = 1`.\n- For the first element `12`: `g` becomes `12` (`gcd(0, 12) = 12`).\n- For the next element `6`: `g` becomes `6` (`gcd(12, 6) = 6`).\n- For the next element `3`: `g` becomes `3` (`gcd(6, 3) = 3`).\n- For the next element `14`: `g` becomes `1` (`gcd(3, 14) = 1`). Since the GCD is now 1:\n  - Increment `ans` to 2.\n  - Update `g` to `14`.\n- For the last element `8`: `g` remains `2` (`gcd(14, 8) = 2`).\n\nSo, you would get two subarrays: `[12, 6, 3]` and `[14, 8]`.\n\nThis should provide a clear path to understanding how to approach and solve this problem using the given methodology.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSplits(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        ans, g = 1, 0\n        for x in nums:\n            g = gcd(g, x)\n            if g == 1:\n                ans += 1\n                g = x\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-split-into-subarrays-with-gcd-greater-than-one"]}, "2854": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2).

The expression needs to be evaluated according to the following rules:\n\n1. **Compute multiplications** from left to right.\n2. **Compute additions** from left to right.\n\nAdditionally, you are provided with an array `answers`, which contains the answers submitted by several students.

This means that after an upward difference, the next difference must be downward and vice versa.\n2. **Objective:** Given an array of integers, you need to find the length of its longest wiggle subsequence. A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the original sequence, but the remaining elements should stay in their original order.\n\n**Examples for Clarity:**\n- Example 1: For [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5], the output is 6 because the entire sequence is already a wiggle sequence.\n- Example 2: For [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8], the output is 7 for subsequence [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8].\n- Example 3: For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the output is 2 for subsequence [1, 9].\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem Using Dynamic Programming:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define two arrays `up` and `down`. \n   - `up[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with an upward trend.\n   - `down[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with a downward trend.\n   - Initialize both arrays with `1` because any single element sequence has a wiggle length of `1`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last.\n   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with all preceding elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend a downward trend sequence ending at `j` to an upward trend at `i`. Update `up[i]` as the maximum of `up[i]` and `down[j] + 1`.\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend an upward trend sequence ending at `j` to a downward trend at `i`. Update `down[i]` as the maximum of `down[i]` and `up[j] + 1`.\n   - Update an overall maximum length `ans` by comparing `up[i]` and `down[i]` after each iteration.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The longest wiggle subsequence length will be the maximum value in the last `ans`, which you maintain throughout the iteration.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to nested loops (iterating each element and comparing it with all preceding elements).\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 7, 4]`:\n\n- Initialize `up = [1, 1, 1]` and `down = [1, 1, 1]`.\n- For `i = 1`, compare `nums[1] (7)` with `nums[0] (1)`:\n  - `7 > 1`, so `up[1] = max(up[1], down[0] + 1)` which results in `up[1] = 2`.

Update `ans` to 3 (now maximum between `up[2]` and `down[2]`).\n\n- The final length is `max(up[2], down[2])`, which is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop a solution to find the longest wiggle subsequence effectively.

Let's break down the problem and our approach to solving it step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou have an integer array `nums` and you need to find the \"beauty\" of each subarray of a given size `k`. The beauty of a subarray is defined as the `x`th smallest negative integer within that subarray. If a subarray has fewer than `x` negative integers, the beauty is `0`.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Use a Sliding Window\n\nThe main technique you will use here is called the \"sliding window\". This means you will continuously move a window of size `k` across the array to examine every contiguous subarray of length `k`.\n\n#### 2. Count Array\n\nGiven the range of integers in `nums` is from `-50` to `50`, you can use an array of fixed size `101` to count the occurrences of each integer. This works because you can shift all values by adding 50 to make them fit within the range `0` to `100`.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. **Initialize Count Array:**\n   - Create an array `cnt` of size `101` to store the count of each number in the range `-50` to `50`. \n   - Initialize all elements of `cnt` to zero.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Window:**\n   - For the first subarray of size `k` in `nums`, update the `cnt` array by incrementing the count at the index corresponding to each number in the subarray (Remember to shift each number by adding 50).\n\n3. **Function to Find xth Smallest Negative:**\n   - Write a helper function that scans through the `cnt` array to find the `x`th smallest negative number. This can be done by traversing through the first `50` elements of `cnt` (which corresponds to numbers from `-50` to `-1` after shifting).\n\n4. **Sliding the Window:**\n   - Start sliding the window from the beginning of the array to the end:\n     - For each new iteration, add the next number coming into the window to the `cnt` array.\n     - Remove the number that is sliding out of the window from the `cnt` array.\n     - Use the helper function to determine the beauty value for the current window and store it in the result list.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - Once you have slid the window across the entire array, return the list of beauty values.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's go through an example to clarify the process:\n\n**Example:**\nInput: `nums = [1, -1, -3, -2, 3]`, `k = 3`, `x = 2`\n\n1. **Initialize `cnt`:**\n   - `cnt` is an array of size `101` all set to `0`.\n\n2. **First Window `[1, -1, -3]`:**\n   - Convert to indices: `[1+50, -1+50, -3+50]` => `[51, 49, 47]`.\n   - Update `cnt`: `cnt[51] = 1`, `cnt[49] = 1`, `cnt[47] = 1`.\n\n3. **Calculate Beauty for First Window:**\n   - Traverse first `50` elements in `cnt` to find the 2nd smallest negative integer.\n   - 2nd smallest negative: `-1`.\n\n4. **Move Window to Next Position `[ -1, -3, -2 ]`:**\n   - Add `-2+50` => `48` to `cnt`.\n   - Remove `1+50` => `51` from `cnt`.\n   - Update `cnt`: `cnt[49] = 1`, `cnt[47] = 1`, `cnt[48] = 1`, `cnt[51] = 0`.\n\n5. **Calculate Beauty for Second Window:**\n   - Traverse `cnt` again.\n   - 2nd smallest negative: `-2`.\n\n6. **Continue Sliding the Window:**\n   - Follow the same steps, move to next window `[ -3, -2, 3 ]`.\n   - Update counts and find the 2nd smallest negative integer for each window position until the end of the array.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to find the beauty values for every subarray of size `k` within the array. This approach ensures you efficiently manage the counting and determination using the sliding window technique and a count array to keep track of number occurrences. This method is efficient and works well within the given problem constraints.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def getSubarrayBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        def f(x: int) -> int:\n            s = 0\n            for i in range(50):\n                s += cnt[i]\n                if s >= x:\n                    return i - 50\n            return 0\n\n        cnt = [0] * 101\n        for v in nums[:k]:\n            cnt[v + 50] += 1\n        ans = [f(x)]\n        for i in range(k, len(nums)):\n            cnt[nums[i] + 50] += 1\n            cnt[nums[i - k] + 50] -= 1\n            ans.append(f(x))\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["sliding-subarray-beauty"]}, "2857": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two integers numBottles and numExchange.\nnumBottles represents the number of full water bottles that you initially have.

Note that each time you perform an exchange, the number required for the next exchange increases by one.\n\n#### Step 2: Drinking Water\n- **Initial Consumption**: You start by drinking all the initial full water bottles. The total number of bottles drunk at this point is equal to `numBottles`.\n\n#### Step 3: Exchange Process\n- **Track Empty Bottles**: Each time you drink a bottle, it turns into an empty one. After drinking all initial bottles, you know that the number of empty bottles matches the number of bottles you initially had (`numBottles`).\n\n#### Step 4: Repeated Operations\n- **Perform Exchanges**: \n  - Check if the number of empty bottles you have is at least `numExchange`.\n  - If you have enough empty bottles to meet (or exceed) `numExchange`, you can exchange them for a full bottle.\n  - Each exchange:\n    - Reduces the number of empty bottles by `numExchange`.\n    - Converts them into one full bottle which you drink immediately. So, increment the total count of drunk bottles by one.\n    - Adds the one bottle you drank as an empty bottle back into the count of empty bottles.\n    - Increase the value of `numExchange` by one (since the number needed for the next exchange increases).\n\n#### Step 5: Terminate the Process\n- **Check for Termination**:\n  - Repeat the exchange process until the number of empty bottles is less than the updated value of `numExchange`. This means you can no longer exchange empty bottles for full ones.\n\n#### Step 6: Return the Result\n- **Total Bottles Drunk**: The result is the total number of bottles you were able to drink throughout the entire process.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - `numBottles = 13`\n   - `numExchange = 6`\n   - Total drunk initially: 13\n\n2. **First Exchange**:\n   - Empty bottles left: 13 (initial full bottles now empty)\n   - Exchange 6 empty bottles for 1 full bottle.\n   - Drink the 1 bottle (Total drunk: 14).\n   - Remaining empty bottles after exchange and drinking: 8 (13 - 6 empty bottles + 1 empty bottle just drunk).\n   - Update `numExchange` to 7.\n\n3. **Next Exchange**:\n   - Empty bottles left: 8\n   - Check if 8 >= 7 (current numExchange), which is true.\n   - Exchange 7 empty bottles for 1 full bottle.\n   - Drink the 1 bottle (Total drunk: 15).\n   - Remaining empty bottles after exchange and drinking: 2 (8 - 7 empty bottles + 1 empty bottle just drunk).\n   - Update `numExchange` to 8.\n\n4. **Final Check**:\n   - Empty bottles left: 2\n   - Check if 2 >= 8, which is false (cannot exchange).\n   - Terminate process.\n\n### Summary of Steps:\n1. Drink all initial bottles.\n2. While the number of empty bottles is at least the current `numExchange`:\n   - Exchange empty bottles for more full bottles.\n   - Increase the total count of drunk bottles.\n   - Adjust for the change in empty bottles and update `numExchange`.\n\n### Final Thought\nThe key to solving this problem is a loop that continues to exchange empty bottles as long as enough are available based on the incrementing exchange requirement.

The bitwise OR operation between two numbers yields another number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. For example:\n\n- 3 OR 1 = 3 (binary: 11 OR 01 = 11)\n\n#### Step 2: Problem Breakdown\n\nYou need to find the smallest subarray starting at each index `i`, such that the bitwise OR of this subarray is maximal compared to any subarray starting at the same index `i`. Given the maximum value in the subarray for each bit position helps compute the shortest subarray efficiently.\n\n#### Step 3: Traverse the Array in Reverse\n\nReverse traversal is useful because it allows us to store and update the latest positions where each bit was seen effectively as we go from the end of the array to the beginning.\n\n#### Step 4: Maintain an Array for Bit Positions\n\nCreate an array `f` to store the latest indices at which each bit position (from 0 to 31, since any integer fits within 32 bits) was seen as 1. Initialize this array with -1 to signify that no bit has been seen initially.\n\n#### Step 5: Process Each Element from End to Start\n\n- For each element in the array (starting from the end):\n  - Initialize a variable `t` to 1. This will store the length of the smallest subarray starting at the current index.\n  - For each bit position from 0 to 31:\n    - Check if the bit at position `j` in the current element (nums[i]) is set (i.e., equal to 1).\n    - If it is set, update the corresponding entry in array `f` to the current index `i`.\n    - If the bit is not set but `f[j]` is not -1 (meaning this bit has been seen set in some later element), calculate the distance `f[j] - i + 1` and potentially update `t`.\n  - Store `t` in the result array `ans` at the current index `i`.\n\n#### Step 6: Final Output\n\nYour final output will be the array `ans`, where each element represents the length of the smallest subarray starting at that index with the maximum possible bitwise OR.\n\n### Detailed Example:\n\nLet's go over an example using the array `[1, 0, 2, 1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `nums = [1, 0, 2, 1, 3]`\n   - `n = 5`\n   - `ans = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (initially, assume the smallest subarray is of length 1)\n   - `f = [-1, -1, -1, ..., -1]` (32 elements all initialized to -1)\n\n2. **Processing the Elements Reverse:**\n   - For `i = 4` (nums[4] = 3):\n     - Bits of `3` are `...0011` (last two bits are set)\n     - Update `f` for bits 0 and 1 to 4: `f[0] = 4`, `f[1] = 4`\n     - `ans[4] = 1`\n   - For `i = 3` (nums[3] = 1):\n     - Bits of `1` are `...0001` (only the last bit is set)\n     - Update `f` for bit 0 to 3: `f[0] = 3`\n     - Since `f[1] = 4`, calculate potential subarray length for bit 1: `4 - 3 + 1 = 2`\n     - `ans[3] = 2`\n   - And so on for the remaining elements...\n\n3. **Complete the Array:**\n   - Continue this process until the start of the array, updating `ans` accordingly.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - After processing all elements, `ans` will contain the desired lengths for the smallest subarrays with maximum bitwise OR starting at each index.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you'll be able to solve the problem and understand the necessary concepts without directly looking at the code implementation.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def smallestSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        ans = [1] * n\n        f = [-1] * 32\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            t = 1\n            for j in range(32):\n                if (nums[i] >> j) & 1:\n                    f[j] = i\n                elif f[j] != -1:\n                    t = max(t, f[j] - i + 1)\n            ans[i] = t\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["smallest-subarrays-with-maximum-bitwise-or"]}, "2867": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou have some coins.\u00a0 The i-th\u00a0coin has a probability\u00a0prob[i] of facing heads when tossed.\nReturn the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target if you toss every coin exactly once.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: prob = [0.4], target = 1\nOutput: 0.40000\n\nExample 2:\nInput: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0\nOutput: 0.03125\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= prob.length <= 1000\n0 <= prob[i] <= 1\n0 <= target\u00a0<= prob.length\nAnswers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.\n\n Solution: \nCertainly! Here is a step-by-step guide that a student could follow to solve the given problem using dynamic programming:\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Problem\n\n#### **Understanding the Problem**\n1. **Problem Statement**: You are given an array of probabilities, where each element represents the probability of a coin landing heads-up. You need to calculate the probability that exactly a certain number (`target`) of coins will land heads-up after you toss all the coins exactly once.\n\n2. **Example and Intuition**:\n    - If `prob = [0.4]` and `target = 1`, there is only one coin with a 40% chance of landing heads. The probability is directly 0.4 since there's only one way this coin toss can result in exactly one head.\n    - If `prob = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` and `target = 0`, this requires all coins to land tails. Since each has a 50% chance, the probability is \\((0.5)^5 = 0.03125\\).\n\n#### **Dynamic Programming Approach**\nTo solve this problem effectively, you can employ a dynamic programming approach.\n\n3. **Defining the State**:\n    - Let's define `f[i][j]` as the probability of getting exactly `j` heads from the first `i` coins. \n    - The value `f[0][0]` is initialized to 1 because with zero coins, the probability of having zero heads is 1 (it\u2019s a certainty).\n\n4. **State Transitions**:\n    - For each coin, you have two options: it lands heads or tails.\n    - If the i-th coin lands tails, the probability of having `j` heads out of the first `i` coins depends on having `j` heads out of the first `i-1` coins.\n    - If the i-th coin lands heads, the probability of having `j` heads from the first `i` coins depends on having `j-1` heads out of the first `i-1` coins.\n\n    **Transition Equations**:\n    - For `j = 0`: `f[i][j] = (1 - p) * f[i-1][j]`\n    - For `j > 0`: `f[i][j] = (1 - p) * f[i-1][j] + p * f[i-1][j-1]`\n    - Here, `p` is the probability that the i-th coin lands heads.\n\n5. **Optimization**:\n    - Notice that each state `f[i][j]` only depends on states from the previous row (`i-1`). Therefore, you can optimize the space complexity by using a single-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional one.\n\n#### **Implementation Steps**\n1. **Initialize the DP Array**:\n    - Create an array `f` with size `target + 1` initialized to 0, except for `f[0]` which should be 1.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Each Coin**:\n    - For each coin's probability, update the DP table from right to left to ensure proper transitions without overwriting values needed for the calculation.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n    - Finally, the entry `f[target]` will give you the probability of exactly `target` heads after tossing all the coins.\n\n#### **Example Walkthrough**\nConsider the `prob = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` and `target = 2`:\n- Initial DP state `f = [1, 0, 0]`\n- **First coin (p=0.5)**:\n    - Update `f[2]`, `f[1]`, and `f[0]` respectively:\n    - For `f[2]`, no change because we can't get 2 heads yet.\n    - For `f[1]`, `f[1] = 0.5 * f[0] = 0.5`\n    - For `f[0]`, `f[0] = 0.5 * f[0] (remaining unchanged) \u2192 f = [0.5, 0.5, 0]`\n- **Second coin (p=0.5)**:\n    - Repeat the updating process: `f = [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]`\n- **Third coin (p=0.5)**:\n    - Final update process: `f = [0.125, 0.375, 0.375]`\n\nThe final value at `f[target] = f[2] = 0.375`, so the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is 0.375.\n\nThis step-by-step approach and dynamic programming framework will help you solve the problem effectively!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def probabilityOfHeads(self, prob: List[float], target: int) -> float:\n        n = len(prob)\n        f = [[0] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        f[0][0] = 1\n        for i, p in enumerate(prob, 1):\n            for j in range(min(i, target) + 1):\n                f[i][j] = (1 - p) * f[i - 1][j]\n                if j:\n                    f[i][j] += p * f[i - 1][j - 1]\n        return f[n][target]\n", "problem_ids": ["toss-strange-coins"]}, "2868": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4\nOutput: 2 \nExplanation: All subarrays are: \n[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.\n[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. \n[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.\n[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.\n[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.\n[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.\n[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.\n[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.\n[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.\n[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. \nTherefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5\nOutput: 4 \nExplanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0\nOutput: 3\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n0 <= limit <= 109\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Problem: Longest Subarray with Limited Difference\n\nThis problem involves finding the size of the longest subarray (a contiguous part of the array) where the absolute difference between any two elements does not exceed a given limit. Let's break down the steps to solve this problem effectively using the Sliding Window technique with an Ordered Set.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - You need to find a subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is less than or equal to a specified limit.\n   - The challenge is to find the longest such subarray within the original array.\n\n2. **Choosing the Right Data Structures**:\n   - Use a sliding window to represent the current subarray being considered.\n   - Use an ordered set (or similar data structure) to maintain and quickly access the minimum and maximum values within the current window.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Sliding Window**:\n   - Initialize two pointers: `i` (right end of the window) and `j` (left end of the window). Both start from the beginning of the array.\n   - Also, initialize a variable (e.g., `ans`) to keep track of the maximum length of valid subarrays found so far.\n\n4. **Expanding the Window**:\n   - As you iterate through the array with the right pointer `i`, add each element to the ordered set and update the window.\n\n5. **Maintaining the Window**:\n   - Check if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the ordered set exceeds the limit.\n   - If it does, increment the left pointer `j` and remove elements from the ordered set until the subarray becomes valid again (i.e., the difference is within the limit).\n\n6. **Recording the Result**:\n   - During each iteration, calculate the size of the current valid subarray (i.e., `i - j + 1`) and update the maximum length found so far (`ans`).\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Consider cases where the array has a single element or all elements are the same.\n   - Ensure your solution handles cases where the limit is zero.\n\n#### Detailed Steps and Example\n\n1. **Initialize the Data Structures**:\n   - Create an ordered set to maintain the elements within the current window.\n   - Set initial values for `ans`, `i`, and `j`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the Array**:\n   - For each element `num` in the array at index `i`:\n     - Add `num` to the ordered set.\n     - Check if the current window is valid:\n       - If the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the ordered set is greater than the limit, move the left pointer `j` to the right, removing elements from the set until the window is valid.\n\n3. **Update the Answer**:\n   - After adjusting the left pointer (if necessary), calculate the length of the current valid subarray using `i - j + 1`.\n   - Update `ans` if the current subarray is the longest found so far.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After iterating through the array, `ans` will contain the size of the longest subarray that satisfies the condition.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider the array `[10, 1, 2, 4, 7, 2]` with `limit = 5`.\n\n- Start with `i = 0`, `j = 0`, and an empty ordered set.\n- Add `10` to the set. Window is `[10]`, max-min = `0`, length = `1`, update `ans` to `1`.\n- Move to `i = 1`. Add `1`. Window is `[10, 1]`, max-min = `9`, which is greater than `5`. Move `j` to `1`, remove `10`. Now valid subarray is `[1]`, length = `1`.\n- Continue this process for each element, maintaining the valid window and updating `ans`.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to identify and maintain the longest subarray satisfying the given conditions.\n\n Solution Code: \nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:\n        sl = SortedList()\n        ans = j = 0\n        for i, x in enumerate(nums):\n            sl.add(x)\n            while sl[-1] - sl[0] > limit:\n                sl.remove(nums[j])\n                j += 1\n            ans = max(ans, i - j + 1)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit"]}, "2869": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative.

This means that after an upward difference, the next difference must be downward and vice versa.\n2. **Objective:** Given an array of integers, you need to find the length of its longest wiggle subsequence. A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the original sequence, but the remaining elements should stay in their original order.\n\n**Examples for Clarity:**\n- Example 1: For [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5], the output is 6 because the entire sequence is already a wiggle sequence.\n- Example 2: For [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8], the output is 7 for subsequence [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8].\n- Example 3: For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the output is 2 for subsequence [1, 9].\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem Using Dynamic Programming:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define two arrays `up` and `down`. \n   - `up[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with an upward trend.\n   - `down[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with a downward trend.\n   - Initialize both arrays with `1` because any single element sequence has a wiggle length of `1`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last.\n   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with all preceding elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend a downward trend sequence ending at `j` to an upward trend at `i`. Update `up[i]` as the maximum of `up[i]` and `down[j] + 1`.\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend an upward trend sequence ending at `j` to a downward trend at `i`. Update `down[i]` as the maximum of `down[i]` and `up[j] + 1`.\n   - Update an overall maximum length `ans` by comparing `up[i]` and `down[i]` after each iteration.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The longest wiggle subsequence length will be the maximum value in the last `ans`, which you maintain throughout the iteration.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to nested loops (iterating each element and comparing it with all preceding elements).\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 7, 4]`:\n\n- Initialize `up = [1, 1, 1]` and `down = [1, 1, 1]`.\n- For `i = 1`, compare `nums[1] (7)` with `nums[0] (1)`:\n  - `7 > 1`, so `up[1] = max(up[1], down[0] + 1)` which results in `up[1] = 2`. Update `ans` to 2 since it's the maximum between `up[1]` and `down[1]`.\n- For `i = 2`, compare `nums[2] (4)` with `nums[0] (1)` and `nums[1] (7)`:\n  - `4 > 1`, so nothing changes because `up[2]` remains 1.\n  - `4 < 7`, so `down[2] = max(down[2], up[1] + 1)` which results in `down[2] = 3`. Update `ans` to 3 (now maximum between `up[2]` and `down[2]`).\n\n- The final length is `max(up[2], down[2])`, which is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop a solution to find the longest wiggle subsequence effectively.

Let's walk through how to solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe need to compute the sum of all XOR totals for every possible subset of a given array `nums`. XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares each bit of its operands. For instance, the XOR of 2 (0010 in binary) and 5 (0101 in binary) is 7 (0111 in binary).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Represent Subsets Using Binary Numbers\n- Each subset of an array can be represented by a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included in the subset (1) or not (0).\n- For example, an array `[a, b, c]` has its subsets represented by:\n  - `000` (empty subset)\n  - `001` (subset with only `c`)\n  - `010` (subset with only `b`)\n  - `011` (subset with `b` and `c`)\n  - and so on.\n\n#### 2. Enumerate All Subsets\n- You can enumerate all subsets by considering all binary numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. In binary form, each number in this range corresponds to a subset.\n\n#### 3. Calculate XOR for Each Subset\n- For each subset represented by binary number `i`, check each bit position. Include the element in the subset if the bit is `1`.\n- Compute the XOR for all included elements.\n\n#### 4. Sum All XOR Results\n- Maintain a running total of the XOR results from all subsets. \n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Create a variable to store the total sum of all XOR results.\n\n2. **Loop Through All Possible Subsets:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through all integers from `0` to `2^n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Each Element:**\n   - For each subset, check each bit of the current integer:\n     - If the bit at position `j` is `1`, include the `j`-th element of `nums` in the subset.\n\n4. **Compute XOR for the Current Subset:**\n   - Initialize a variable for the current XOR total. For each `1` bit found, XOR it with the current total.\n\n5. **Add the XOR Result to Total:**\n   - After computing the XOR for the current subset, add it to the running total.\n\n6. **Return the Total Sum:**\n   - Once all subsets are processed, return the running total.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's say the array is `[1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `total_sum = 0`\n\n2. **Generate Subsets:**\n   - The length `n = 2`, so iterate over `i` from `0` to `3` (`2^2 - 1`).\n\n3. **Subset by `i = 0` (`00` in binary):**\n   - No elements included. XOR total = `0`.\n   - Add `0` to `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Subset by `i = 1` (`01` in binary):**\n   - Include element `1`. XOR total = `1`.\n   - Add `1` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 1`.\n\n5. **Subset by `i = 2` (`10` in binary):**\n   - Include element `3`. XOR total = `3`.\n   - Add `3` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 4`.\n\n6. **Subset by `i = 3` (`11` in binary):**\n   - Include elements `1` and `3`. XOR total = `1 XOR 3 = 2`.\n   - Add `2` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 6`.\n\nFinal output is `6`, as the sum of all XOR totals for every subset is `6`.\n\nUsing this structured approach will help you understand and solve the problem efficiently.

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "2873": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a m x n 0-indexed 2D matrix mat.

Your task is to create numbers by traveling through the matrix in eight possible directions: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east. Each number is created by appending digits as you move in a chosen direction.\n\nFor example, if you start at cell \\((0, 0)\\) and move east, and the digits in the cells you visit are 1, 1, 1, the numbers you generate at each step will be 1, 11, 111.\n\nYour objective is to:\n\n1. Find all numbers created by moving from every cell in each of the eight directions.\n2. Identify which of these numbers are prime numbers greater than 10.\n3. Determine the prime number that appears most frequently. If there are multiple prime numbers with the same highest frequency, choose the largest one.\n4. If no such prime number exists, return -1.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Set up a counter to keep track of the frequency of each prime number greater than 10 that you find.\n\n2. **Define a Function to Check for Prime Numbers:**\n   - Write a helper function to check if a number is prime. Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1, which has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Each Cell in the Matrix:**\n   - For each cell in the matrix, consider it as the starting point and generate numbers by moving in each of the eight possible directions.\n\n4. **Generate Numbers by Moving in Each Direction:**\n   - Every time you move to a new cell, append its digit to the current number being formed.\n   - After forming a new number, check if it is a prime number greater than 10.\n   - If the number meets the criteria, update its frequency in your counter.\n\n5. **Track the Most Frequent Prime Number:**\n   - Once you've generated and checked all possible numbers, go through your counter to find the prime number with the highest frequency.\n   - If there are ties (multiple numbers with the same highest frequency), pick the largest prime number among them.\n\n6. **Return the Result:**\n   - If you find at least one prime number greater than 10, return the one which meets the requirements from the previous step.\n   - If no such prime number exists, return -1.\n\n#### Detailed Implementation Strategy:\n\n1. **Helper Function for Prime Check:**\n   - Use an efficient method to check for prime numbers due to the boundary constraints, such as iterating up to the square root of the number.\n\n2. **Directional Movements:**\n   - Define your 8 possible movements as pairs of coordinates. For example, east movement might be defined as (0, 1), south-east as (1, 1), and so on.\n\n3. **Number Generation:**\n   - Start from each cell and continue appending digits as you move in a specified direction until you go out of the matrix bounds.\n   - Convert the sequence of digits into a number.\n\n4. **Prime Validation:**\n   - After forming each number, check if it is a prime and greater than 10. If it is, add it to your counter.\n\n5. **Final Analysis:**\n   - After processing the entire matrix, analyze your counter to determine the most frequent and largest prime number.\n\nThis strategy ensures that all potential numbers are considered and primes greater than 10 are properly identified and counted. The final step picks the optimal prime based on frequency and value criteria.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def mostFrequentPrime(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        def is_prime(x: int) -> int:\n            return all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, isqrt(x) + 1))\n\n        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])\n        cnt = Counter()\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                for a in range(-1, 2):\n                    for b in range(-1, 2):\n                        if a == 0 and b == 0:\n                            continue\n                        x, y, v = i + a, j + b, mat[i][j]\n                        while 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n:\n                            v = v * 10 + mat[x][y]\n                            if is_prime(v):\n                                cnt[v] += 1\n                            x, y = x + a, y + b\n        ans, mx = -1, 0\n        for v, x in cnt.items():\n            if mx < x:\n                mx = x\n                ans = v\n            elif mx == x:\n                ans = max(ans, v)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["most-frequent-prime"]}, "2876": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "2877": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.\nIn one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it.

The idea is to explore different ways to delete digits and track the smallest number of deletions needed to achieve a number that is divisible by 25.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   Create a function that starts from a given position in the string and considers whether to keep or delete the current digit.\n\n2. **Base Case**:\n   If you have processed all characters in the string:\n   - Check if the remaining string forms a number divisible by 25.\n   - If yes, return 0 (no more digits needed to be removed).\n   - If no, return a large number (e.g., length of the string), indicating this path is invalid.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**:\n   For each digit:\n   - You have two options: either delete it or keep it.\n   - **If you delete it**:\n     - Move to the next digit and increase the deletion count by 1.\n   - **If you keep it**:\n     - Modify the remainder when the current number formed so far is divided by 25 and proceed to the next digit without increasing the deletion count.\n\n4. **Memoization**:\n   To optimize, use memoization to store results of subproblems\u2014this prevents solving the same subproblem multiple times.\n\n5. **Initialization**:\n   Call the recursive function starting from the first digit and with an initial remainder of 0.\n\n### Steps in Code-Independent Terms\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   Define the length of the given string.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**:\n   Implement a helper function `dfs(current_index, current_remainder)` to:\n   - Check if you have reached the end of the string.\n   - If you have, return 0 if `current_remainder` is 0 (indicating current number is divisible by 25), otherwise return a large number.\n\n3. **Choosing to Delete or Keep a Digit**:\n   - Recursively call without including the current digit (incrementing deletions).\n   - Recursively call including the current digit (update remainder).\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Choose the option (deletion or keeping) that results in the minimum deletions.\n\n5. **Optimize with Memoization**:\n   Use a dictionary or similar structure to store results for each state `(index, remainder)`.\n\n6. **Result**:\n   The minimum deletions needed from the start of the string with a remainder of 0.\n\n### Example Execution\n\nWalk through an example to visualize how the solution works:\n- For `num = \"2245047\"`:\n  - Delete digits indexed [5] and [6] to achieve \"22450\" which is divisible by 25.\n\n### Consider Edge Cases:\n\n- When the string length is 1 (the minimum possible length).\n- When the string is already divisible by 25.\n- When the string has complex patterns requiring multiple deletions.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you should be able to systematically solve the problem of minimizing deletions to form a number divisible by 25!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperations(self, num: str) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, k: int) -> int:\n            if i == n:\n                return 0 if k == 0 else n\n            ans = dfs(i + 1, k) + 1\n            ans = min(ans, dfs(i + 1, (k * 10 + int(num[i])) % 25))\n            return ans\n\n        n = len(num)\n        return dfs(0, 0)\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number"]}, "2878": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "2879": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s and a positive integer k.\nSelect a set of non-overlapping substrings from the string s that satisfy the following conditions:\n\nThe length of each substring is at least k.\nEach substring is a palindrome.\n\nReturn the maximum number of substrings in an optimal selection.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abaccdbbd\", k = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = \"abaccdbbd\".

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. \n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints and Definitions:**\n   - You can use any substring of \\(s\\) which means a contiguous part of the string.\n   - Each selected substring must be a palindrome of at least length \\(k\\).\n   - Substrings should be non-overlapping.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table for Palindromic Substrings:**\n   - Create a 2D list (or table) called `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be True if the substring \\(s[i..j]\\) is a palindrome, otherwise False.\n   - Initialize all diagonal elements `dp[i][i]` to True because a single character is a palindrome.\n   - Use dynamic programming to fill out this table for all possible substrings:\n     - For substrings of length 2, `s[i..i+1]` is a palindrome if \\(s[i] == s[i+1]\\).\n     - For longer substrings, `s[i..j]` is a palindrome if \\(s[i] == s[j]\\) and the inner substring \\(s[i+1..j-1]\\) is a palindrome (i.e., `dp[i+1][j-1]` is True).\n\n3. **Define a Recursive Function with Memoization:**\n   - Define a function \\(dfs(i)\\) which calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping palindromic substrings starting from index \\(i\\).\n   - The function performs the following:\n     - If \\(i\\) is out of bounds (end of string), return 0.\n     - Calculate the result for skipping the current character (\\(i\\)) and exploring further, i.e., \\(dfs(i+1)\\).\n     - Check all possible endings \\(j\\) starting from \\(i\\) such that the length \\((j - i + 1) \\ge k\\) and \\(s[i..j]\\) is a palindrome (\\(dp[i][j]\\)).\n     - For each valid ending \\(j\\), calculate the result if you pick substring \\(s[i..j]\\), i.e., \\(1 + dfs(j+1)\\).\n     - Use memoization to store results of already computed states to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Initialize the \\(dfs\\) function from the start of the string (index 0).\n   - Return the maximum number of selected substrings obtained from your \\(dfs\\) function.\n   - Clear any caches related to memoization if necessary towards the end to maintain clean code state in case of multiple test cases or runs.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   ```plaintext\n   s = \"abaccdbbd\", k = 3\n   ```\n   - Create a `dp` table of size \\((n \\times n)\\) where \\(n\\) is the length of \\(s\\).\n\n2. **Filling out the \\(dp\\) table:**\n   - Loop from the end of the string to the beginning for starting indices.\n   - For each start index, calculate palindromic states for all possible end indices.\n\n3. **Recursive DFS with Memoization:**\n   - Define \\(dfs\\) starting from index 0.\n   - Use the \\(dp\\) table to check for valid palindromic substrings and recursively find the maximum number of such substrings.\n\n4. **Returning the Answer:**\n   - Call \\(dfs(0)\\) to get the final count of maximum non-overlapping palindromic substrings.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to find the optimal solution to the problem efficiently. The use of dynamic programming to preprocess palindromic substrings and recursion with memoization ensures that the solution runs within the acceptable time limits for the given constraints.\n\nGood luck, and happy coding!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maxPalindromes(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i):\n            if i >= n:\n                return 0\n            ans = dfs(i + 1)\n            for j in range(i + k - 1, n):\n                if dp[i][j]:\n                    ans = max(ans, 1 + dfs(j + 1))\n            return ans\n\n        n = len(s)\n        dp = [[True] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                dp[i][j] = s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]\n        ans = dfs(0)\n        dfs.cache_clear()\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-palindrome-substrings"]}, "2881": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two string arrays, queries and dictionary.

Each word is composed of lowercase English letters and has the same fixed length across both lists. Our task is to find all words in `queries` that can be converted into any word in `dictionary` with at most two letter changes. We need to return these words in the same order they appear in `queries`.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Both `queries` and `dictionary` contain words of the same length.\n   - We can change any letter in a word from `queries` to any other letter, and we need to determine if it can match a word from `dictionary` with at most two such changes.\n   - The goal is to return a list of words from `queries` that meet this criterion.\n\n2. **Plan the Solution:**\n   - For each word in `queries`, compare it with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - Count the number of differing letters between each pair of words.\n   - If the count of differing letters is less than or equal to two, record the word from `queries`.\n\n3. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the words from `queries` that can match with words from `dictionary` with up to two edits.\n   - Use nested loops to compare each word in `queries` with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - For this comparison, iterate through the letters of both words simultaneously and count the differences.\n   - If the differences are two or fewer, add the word from `queries` to the result list and break out of the inner loop (since one match is enough).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations:**\n   - The time complexity is determined by the number of comparisons we make between the words.\n   - Each word comparison takes linear time relative to the word length.\n   - Given that the lengths of `queries` and `dictionary` can each be up to 100 and the word length can be up to 100, ensure your approach can handle the worst-case scenario efficiently.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider the following example:\n```python\nqueries = [\"word\", \"note\", \"ants\", \"wood\"]\ndictionary = [\"wood\", \"joke\", \"moat\"]\n```\n- Compare \"word\" with \"wood\": One edit needed ('r' to 'o'), so \"word\" matches.\n- Compare \"note\" with \"joke\": Two edits needed ('n' to 'j' and 't' to 'k'), so \"note\" matches.\n- Compare \"ants\" with all dictionary words: Requires more than two edits for each, so \"ants\" does not match.\n- Compare \"wood\" with \"wood\": No edits needed, so \"wood\" matches.\n\nThus, the output is `[\"word\", \"note\", \"wood\"]`.\n\n#### Algorithm Pseudocode:\n\n```text\ninitialize an empty list result\n\nfor each word s in queries:\n    for each word t in dictionary:\n        count differences between s and t\n        if differences are <= 2:\n            add s to result\n            break out of inner loop\n\nreturn result\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Ensure you correctly understand how to count the number of letter differences between two words efficiently.\n- Be mindful of the break condition in the inner loop \u2013 it helps avoid unnecessary comparisons once a match is found.\n- Use list comprehensions and Python's built-in functions efficiently for counting and managing iterations.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to implement a solution that identifies all words in `queries` that can be transformed into any word in `dictionary` with at most two edits.

The pattern `p`, which can contain lowercase English letters, '?' and '*'.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the pattern `p` matches the entire input string `s`. Here\u2019s how the special characters work in the pattern:\n- `?` matches any single character.\n- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).\n\nFor example:\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"a\"` should return `false` because \"a\" does not match \"aa\".\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"*\"` should return `true` because '*' can match any sequence, including \"aa\".\n- `s = \"cb\", p = \"?a\"` should return `false` because although '?' matches 'c', 'a' does not match 'b'.\n\n#### Approach to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem effectively, you can use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - Design a function `dfs(i, j)` that will check if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` matches the substring of `p` starting from index `j`.\n   - The result would be stored in a cache to avoid recomputation.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `i` (the current position in `s`) is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, the function should return `True` only if `j` (the current position in `p`) is also at or beyond the end of `p`, or if the remaining characters in `p` are all '*'.\n   - If `j` is beyond the length of `p` but `i` isn't, return `False` since pattern `p` lacks more characters to match with `s`.\n\n3. **Handling '*' Character**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '*', check the following possibilities:\n     - The '*' matches zero characters \u2013 move to the next character in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i, j + 1)`).\n     - The '*' matches one or more characters \u2013 move to the next character in `s` but keep the current position in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j)`) or move to the next character in both `s` and `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n4. **Handling '?' Character or Exact Match**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '?' or the characters in `s` and `p` match, then move to the next characters in both the strings (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n5. **Memoization**:\n   - Use a caching mechanism to store the results of function calls to avoid redundant calculations. This will help in improving the efficiency drastically.\n\n6. **Final Check**:\n   - Begin the recursion from the start of both the strings (i.e., call `dfs(0, 0)`).\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\nYou can summarize the above logic into the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction isMatch(s, p):\n    memo = createEmptyCache()  # Initialize a cache to store results\n\n    Define function dfs(i, j):\n        if i >= length(s):\n            return j >= length(p) OR (p[j] == '*' AND func(i, j + 1))\n        if j >= length(p):\n            return False\n        if p[j] == '*':\n            return dfs(i + 1, j) OR dfs(i + 1, j + 1) OR dfs(i, j + 1)\n        return (p[j] == '?' OR s[i] == p[j]) AND dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n    return dfs(0, 0)\n\nCall isMatch with the strings s and p.\n```\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to construct a solution for the wildcard pattern matching problem by carefully defining and implementing the recursive function `dfs` with memoization. This will ensure you handle all possible pattern matching scenarios efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> bool:\n            if i >= len(s):\n                return j >= len(p) or (p[j] == \"*\" and dfs(i, j + 1))\n            if j >= len(p):\n                return False\n            if p[j] == \"*\":\n                return dfs(i + 1, j) or dfs(i + 1, j + 1) or dfs(i, j + 1)\n            return (p[j] == \"?\" or s[i] == p[j]) and dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n        return dfs(0, 0)\n", "problem_ids": ["wildcard-matching"]}, "2883": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.\n\nFor example, the appeal of \"abbca\" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nGiven a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abbca\"\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of \"abbca\":\n- Substrings of length 1: \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively.

For the given problem, you need to determine the total appeal of all possible substrings of a given string `s`. A substring is any continuous sequence of characters within the string.\n\nHere's how you can approach solving this problem efficiently without having to repeatedly iterate over every possible substring.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**\n   - You need to calculate the total appeal of all substrings of a given string `s`.\n   - The appeal of a substring is the count of unique characters in that substring.\n\n2. **Outline the Strategy**\n   - To avoid computing the appeal from scratch for every substring, use the fact that you can build upon previous computations.\n   - Use an array to track the last position each character was seen in the string.\n\n3. **Detailed Steps**\n\n   **Step 1: Initialize Variables**\n   - Initialize a variable `t` to keep track of the appeal sum for substrings ending at the current character.\n   - Initialize another variable `ans` to store the cumulative total of all appeals.\n   - Create an array `pos` of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) initialized to `-1`. This array keeps track of the last occurrence of each character.\n\n   **Step 2: Traverse the String**\n   - Loop through each character in the string along with its index.\n   - For each character:\n     - Convert the character to a corresponding index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).\n     - Calculate the contribution of this character to `t`:\n       - If the character hasn't appeared before (position in `pos` is `-1`), then all substrings ending before this character increase their appeal by 1 because this character is new.\n       - If the character appeared before, determine the last position it appeared, say `j`. Then only the substrings that start after position `j` and end at current character will see an increase in appeal by 1 (as the character was already included in substrings before `j`).\n     - Update `t` and add it to `ans`.\n     - Update the `pos` array with the current position of this character.\n\n   **Step 3: Return the Result**\n   - After the loop, the variable `ans` contains the total appeal of all substrings.\n\n4. **Optimization Insight**\n   - By leveraging the last seen positions of characters, you prevent re-evaluating the appeal of substrings unnecessarily. This approach ensures that your solution has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.\n   - The space complexity remains `O(1)` or more specifically `O(26)` due to the fixed size of the `pos` array.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\nLet\u2019s walk through an example manually to understand the logic:\n\nExample: `s = \"abbca\"`\n\n- Initial values:\n  - `ans = 0`\n  - `t = 0`\n  - `pos = [-1, -1, -1, ..., -1]`  (length 26)\n\n- Iteration 1: (i = 0, c = 'a')\n  - `c_idx = 0`\n  - `t = t + i - pos[c_idx] = 0 + 0 - (-1) = 1`\n  - `ans = ans + t = 0 + 1 = 1`\n  - Update `pos[0]` = 0\n\n- Iteration 2: (i = 1, c = 'b')\n  - `c_idx = 1`\n  - `t = t + i - pos[c_idx] = 1 + 1 - (-1) = 3`\n  - `ans = ans + t = 1 + 3 = 4`\n  - Update `pos[1]` = 1\n\n- Iteration 3: (i = 2, c = 'b')\n  - `c_idx = 1`\n  - `t = t + i - pos[c_idx] = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4`\n  - `ans = ans + t = 4 + 4 = 8`\n  - Update `pos[1]` = 2\n\n- Iteration 4: (i = 3, c = 'c')\n  - `c_idx = 2`\n  - `t = t + i - pos[c_idx] = 4 + 3 - (-1) = 8`\n  - `ans = ans + t = 8 + 8 = 16`\n  - Update `pos[2]` = 3\n\n- Iteration 5: (i = 4, c = 'a')\n  - `c_idx = 0`\n  - `t = t + i - pos[c_idx] = 8 + 4 - 0 = 12`\n  - `ans = ans + t = 16 + 12 = 28`\n  - Update `pos[0]` = 4\n\n4. **Return the Result**\n   - The final value of `ans` is 28, so we return 28.\n\nThis methodology ensures that every substring is accounted for efficiently, using previously computed values to build the final result.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def appealSum(self, s: str) -> int:\n        ans = t = 0\n        pos = [-1] * 26\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            c = ord(c) - ord('a')\n            t += i - pos[c]\n            ans += t\n            pos[c] = i\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["total-appeal-of-a-string"]}, "2884": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two string arrays words1 and words2.\nA string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.\n\nFor example, \"wrr\" is a subset of \"warrior\" but is not a subset of \"world\".\n\nA string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.\nReturn an array of all the universal strings in words1.

Your task is to determine which words in `words1` are \"universal.\" A word from `words1` is considered universal if it contains all the letters in each word from `words2` with at least the same frequency.\n\nFor instance:\n- If `words2 = [\"e\",\"o\"]`, any universal word in `words1` must contain at least one 'e' and one 'o'.\n- If `words2 = [\"l\",\"e\"]`, any universal word in `words1` must contain at least one 'l' and one 'e'.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n1. **Count the Maximum Frequency of Each Letter in Words2:**\n    - Create a frequency dictionary (`cnt`), which tracks the maximum frequency of each letter required by any word in `words2`.\n    - For each word in `words2`, count the frequency of each letter.\n    - Update the frequency dictionary to ensure it records the highest frequency for each letter found across all words in `words2`.\n\n2. **Check Each Word in Words1:**\n    - For each word in `words1`, count the frequency of each letter.\n    - Compare this frequency with the frequency dictionary (`cnt`). If the word from `words1` meets or exceeds the required frequencies for all letters specified in `cnt`, it is considered a universal word.\n\n3. **Collect and Return the Universal Words:**\n    - Make a list of all words from `words1` that are determined to be universal based on the above checks.\n    - Return this list.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Frequency Dictionary:**\n    - Use an empty dictionary or a `Counter` to keep track of the maximum frequency of each letter required by any of the words in `words2`.\n\n2. **Update Frequency Dictionary:**\n    - Loop through each word in `words2`.\n    - For each word, loop through its letters and count their occurrences.\n    - For each letter in the word, update the frequency dictionary to store the highest frequency encountered for that letter.\n\n3. **Frequency Comparison for Words1:**\n    - Create an empty list to store the universal words.\n    - Loop through each word in `words1`.\n    - For each word, count the frequency of its letters.\n    - Check if this word contains each letter in frequencies that meet or exceed those in the frequency dictionary (`cnt`).\n    - If it does, add this word to the list of universal words.\n\n4. **Return the Result:**\n    - Return the list of all universal words found.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's walk through an example to make it clearer:\n\n- **Example Input:**\n    ```python\n    words1 = [\"amazon\", \"apple\", \"facebook\", \"google\", \"leetcode\"]\n    words2 = [\"e\", \"o\"]\n    ```\n\n- **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n    **Step 1: Initialize the Frequency Dictionary**\n    - For words2 = [\"e\", \"o\"]:\n        - \"e\" contributes: {'e': 1}\n        - \"o\" contributes: {'o': 1}\n        \n    Thus, `cnt = {'e': 1, 'o': 1}`.\n\n    **Step 2: Compare Words from words1:**\n    - For \"amazon\":\n        - Count of letters: {'a': 2, 'm': 1, 'z': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1}\n        - 'e' frequency (1 needed, 0 found) => Not universal.\n    - For \"apple\":\n        - Count of letters: {'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}\n        - 'o' frequency (1 needed, 0 found) => Not universal.\n    - For \"facebook\":\n        - Count of letters: {'f': 1, 'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'e': 2, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'k': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n    - For \"google\":\n        - Count of letters: {'g': 2, 'o': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n    - For \"leetcode\":\n        - Count of letters: {'l': 1, 'e': 3, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'o': 1, 'd': 1}\n        - Both 'e' and 'o' frequencies meet requirements => Universal.\n\n    Therefore, the universal words are `[\"facebook\", \"google\", \"leetcode\"]`.\n\n#### Summary:\n- Use a frequency dictionary to track the highest letter frequency required by any word in `words2`.\n- Check each word in `words1` against this frequency dictionary.\n- Collect and return all words from `words1` that meet the letter frequency requirements.\n\nFollow these steps, and you should be able to determine the universal words efficiently.

These two cases require left-justification.\n   - If it's either the last line or a line with one word:\n     - Join all words in the current line with a single space between each word.\n     - Append spaces at the end to make the total length equal to `maxWidth`.\n   - If it's not the last line and contains more than one word:\n     - Calculate the total number of spaces needed to distribute.\n     - Allocate spaces evenly between words. If the spaces cannot be distributed evenly, assign more spaces to the leftmost gaps first.\n     - Construct the line by alternating between words and spaces.\n\n#### Step 3: Construct Fully Justified Lines\n1. **Distribute Spaces Evenly**:\n   - Calculate the required spaces by subtracting the total length of the characters in the words from `maxWidth`.\n   - Distribute these spaces between the words as evenly as possible.\n   - If there are gaps that cannot be evenly distributed, assign the extra spaces to the leftmost gaps first.\n\n2. **Build the Line**:\n   - For lines that are not the final line or only one word:\n       - Alternate appending words and the calculated spaces until the line is complete.\n   - For the final line or lines with a single word:\n       - Simply join the words with a single space and pad the end with extra spaces to reach `maxWidth`.\n\n#### Step 4: Compile the Results\n- Continue iterating through the array of words, constructing each line according to the above rules until you process all words.\n- Append each constructed line to your result list.\n\n#### Step 5: Return the Result List\n- Once all lines are processed and appended to the result list, return this list as the final output.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nTo illustrate, let's consider the example with `words = [\"This\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\", \"of\", \"text\", \"justification.\"]` and `maxWidth = 16`.\n\n1. The first line will start with \"This\". Keep adding words until adding another word exceeds `maxWidth`. Here, \"This is an\" would be the first line (word lengths sum up to 9 and we have added 2 spaces):\n   - Total characters: 9 (4+2+2+1), remaining spaces: 16 - 9 = 7.\n   - Distribute the 7 spaces: \"This    is    an\".\n   \n2. For the second line, continue with \"example\". Adding \"of text\" fits within `maxWidth`:\n   - Total characters: 12 (7+2+4+1), remaining spaces: 16 - 9 = 4.\n   - Distribute the 4 spaces: \"example  of text\".\n\n3. The last word \"justification.\" forms the last line on its own:\n   - Since it is the last line, it will be left-justified: \"justification.  \".\n\nThe final output would be:\n```plaintext\n[\n    \"This    is    an\",\n    \"example  of text\",\n    \"justification.  \"\n]\n```\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to consistently construct fully justified lines of text for any given input array of words and maximum width.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def fullJustify(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:\n        ans = []\n        i, n = 0, len(words)\n        while i < n:\n            t = []\n            cnt = len(words[i])\n            t.append(words[i])\n            i += 1\n            while i < n and cnt + 1 + len(words[i]) <= maxWidth:\n                cnt += 1 + len(words[i])\n                t.append(words[i])\n                i += 1\n            if i == n or len(t) == 1:\n                left = ' '.join(t)\n                right = ' ' * (maxWidth - len(left))\n                ans.append(left + right)\n                continue\n            space_width = maxWidth - (cnt - len(t) + 1)\n            w, m = divmod(space_width, len(t) - 1)\n            row = []\n            for j, s in enumerate(t[:-1]):\n                row.append(s)\n                row.append(' ' * (w + (1 if j < m else 0)))\n            row.append(t[-1])\n            ans.append(''.join(row))\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["text-justification"]}, "2887": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\nThe initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\nIf more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    \nIncrease the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.\n        \nFor example, say you start with the words [\"abcdef\",\"abndef\"] both initially abbreviated as \"a4f\".

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "2888": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.

If at any point the heap size exceeds k, remove the least frequent element.\n3. **Output the Result**: Convert the elements in the heap to a list of results.\n\n#### Step 3: Implementing the Solution\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse the array and use a dictionary to count occurrences of each element.\n   - For instance, if the array is `[1,1,1,2,2,3]`, your dictionary will look like `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.\n\n2. **Using a Min Heap**:\n   - Use a min heap to store elements based on their frequency.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary and push each entry (element and its frequency) into the heap.\n   - Ensure the heap size does not exceed k. If it does, remove the smallest element (in terms of frequency).\n\n3. **Extract the k Most Frequent Elements**:\n   - Once all elements have been processed, extract the elements from the heap. These will be the k most frequent elements in the array.\n\n#### Step 4: Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize a Dictionary**:\n   - Create a dictionary to store frequencies of elements.\n   - Example: `cnt = {}`.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse each element in the array.\n   - For each element, if it is not present in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1. If it is present, increment its count.\n\n3. **Use a Min Heap**:\n   - Initialize a min heap.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary entries.\n   - For each entry, push it into the heap along with its frequency.\n   - If the heap size exceeds k, pop the smallest element.\n\n4. **Formulate the Result**:\n   - Extract elements from the heap.\n   - These will be your results.\n\n#### Step 5: Optimizations\n- **Time Complexity**: Using a hash table to count elements takes \\(O(n)\\) time, where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array.\n- **Heap Operations**: Inserting and removing from a heap of size k takes \\(O(\\log k)\\) time. Since we perform this for n elements, the time complexity for the heap operations is \\(O(n \\log k)\\).\n- **Space Complexity**: Space for storing counts in the dictionary is \\(O(n)\\). The heap space is \\(O(k)\\). Overall, space complexity is \\(O(n + k)\\).\n\n#### Step 6: Implementation Tips\n- Use the `collections.Counter` class in Python for easy frequency counting.\n- Use the `heapq` module for heap operations, which provides an efficient way to handle priority queues.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem of finding the k most frequent elements in an array.

Let's walk through a detailed guide to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing a limited number of increment operations on an array.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Frequency Definition**: The frequency of an element in an array is the number of times that element appears in the array.\n2. **Operations Allowed**: You can choose an index in the array and increment the element at that index by 1. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.\n3. **Goal**: After at most `k` operations, determine the maximum frequency of any element in the array.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Element Choice**: The element with the highest post-operation frequency must be one of the elements from the original array.\n2. **Continuous Subarray**: To maximize frequency, the elements chosen for the increment operations are in a continuous subarray in the sorted version of the array.\n3. **Binary Search Application**: If a certain frequency is achievable, then any lower frequency is also achievable. This insight suggests using binary search to effectively find the maximum frequency.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the given array in non-decreasing order. This helps in easily forming and analyzing continuous subarrays.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Create a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sorted array. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of elements in any subarray.\n\n3. **Binary Search Setup**: \n    - Set the initial left boundary (`l`) of the binary search to 1 and the right boundary (`r`) to the length of the array.\n    - In each step of the binary search, check the midpoint (`mid`) for whether it's possible to achieve a frequency of `mid` with the given number of operations (`k`).\n\n4. **Check Feasibility of Achieving a Frequency**: \n    - For a given subarray of length `m` (midpoint value in binary search), compute the total number of operations needed to make all elements in the subarray equal to the maximum element of that subarray.\n    - This is done by calculating if `max_element * m - sum_of_subarray` is less than or equal to `k`.\n    - If yes, it means achieving this frequency is feasible; otherwise, it's not.\n\n5. **Adjust Binary Search Boundaries**:\n    - If the frequency `m` is feasible, move the left boundary up to `m`.\n    - If not feasible, move the right boundary down to `m - 1`.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n    - The maximum frequency will be in the left boundary (`l`) after the binary search completes.\n\n### Pseudo-Implementation\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: `nums.sort()`\n2. **Create Prefix Sum Array**: Use cumulative sum to create an array `s` where `s[i]` denotes the sum of the first `i` elements.\n3. **Binary Search**:\n    - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = len(nums)`\n    - Define a function to check feasibility of a given frequency `m`.\n    - Perform binary search using the feasibility function and adjust boundaries accordingly.\n4. **Return the Left Boundary**: When binary search completes, `l` will give the maximum possible frequency.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThis problem combines sorting, prefix sum calculations, and binary search \u2014 all standard yet powerful techniques. The crux of the solution lies in efficiently determining whether a certain frequency can be achieved with the given number of operations, leveraging prefix sums to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the key insights, you can confidently approach and solve the problem.

This means that after an upward difference, the next difference must be downward and vice versa.\n2. **Objective:** Given an array of integers, you need to find the length of its longest wiggle subsequence. A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the original sequence, but the remaining elements should stay in their original order.\n\n**Examples for Clarity:**\n- Example 1: For [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5], the output is 6 because the entire sequence is already a wiggle sequence.\n- Example 2: For [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8], the output is 7 for subsequence [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8].\n- Example 3: For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the output is 2 for subsequence [1, 9].\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem Using Dynamic Programming:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define two arrays `up` and `down`. \n   - `up[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with an upward trend.\n   - `down[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with a downward trend.\n   - Initialize both arrays with `1` because any single element sequence has a wiggle length of `1`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last.\n   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with all preceding elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend a downward trend sequence ending at `j` to an upward trend at `i`. Update `up[i]` as the maximum of `up[i]` and `down[j] + 1`.\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend an upward trend sequence ending at `j` to a downward trend at `i`. Update `down[i]` as the maximum of `down[i]` and `up[j] + 1`.\n   - Update an overall maximum length `ans` by comparing `up[i]` and `down[i]` after each iteration.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The longest wiggle subsequence length will be the maximum value in the last `ans`, which you maintain throughout the iteration.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to nested loops (iterating each element and comparing it with all preceding elements).\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 7, 4]`:\n\n- Initialize `up = [1, 1, 1]` and `down = [1, 1, 1]`.\n- For `i = 1`, compare `nums[1] (7)` with `nums[0] (1)`:\n  - `7 > 1`, so `up[1] = max(up[1], down[0] + 1)` which results in `up[1] = 2`. Update `ans` to 2 since it's the maximum between `up[1]` and `down[1]`.\n- For `i = 2`, compare `nums[2] (4)` with `nums[0] (1)` and `nums[1] (7)`:\n  - `4 > 1`, so nothing changes because `up[2]` remains 1.\n  - `4 < 7`, so `down[2] = max(down[2], up[1] + 1)` which results in `down[2] = 3`. Update `ans` to 3 (now maximum between `up[2]` and `down[2]`).\n\n- The final length is `max(up[2], down[2])`, which is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop a solution to find the longest wiggle subsequence effectively.

Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "2915": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two 0-indexed binary arrays nums1 and nums2.

Initialize this with the entry (0, -1) to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning has a sum of zero.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compute**:\n    - Traverse through each element of the \"differences\" array, calculating the prefix sum at each step.\n    - For each prefix sum, check if it has been seen before in the hash table:\n        - If yes, it means there is a subarray (from the first occurrence + 1 to the current index) with a sum of zero. Update the answer if the current subarray is the widest so far.\n        - If no, store the current prefix sum with its index in the hash table for the first time.\n    - Continue this process until you've examined all elements.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n    - The answer stored will be the distance of the widest (i, j) pair found.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n    - Declare a dictionary `d` to store prefix sums and their first occurrences. Initialize it with `{0: -1}`.\n    - Initialize variables `ans` (to track the widest distance) and `s` (for the running prefix sum) to 0.\n\n2. **Traverse the Arrays**:\n    - For each index \\(i\\), compute the difference between elements of nums1 and nums2, and add this to the running prefix sum \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Update the Hash Table**:\n    - Check if this prefix sum \\(s\\) is already in the dictionary `d`:\n        - If it is, calculate the distance using \\(i - d[s]\\) and update `ans` if this distance is larger than the current maximum.\n        - If it is not in the dictionary, store \\(s\\) with the current index \\(i\\).\n\n4. **Completion**:\n    - After the entire array has been processed, the value of `ans` will be the result.\n\nBy following these steps, the algorithm efficiently finds the widest pair of indices with equal sums in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity and \\(O(n)\\) space complexity due to the use of prefix sums and a hash table for quick lookups.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def widestPairOfIndices(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:\n        d = {0: -1}\n        ans = s = 0\n        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(nums1, nums2)):\n            s += a - b\n            if s in d:\n                ans = max(ans, i - d[s])\n            else:\n                d[s] = i\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["widest-pair-of-indices-with-equal-range-sum"]}, "2916": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative.

This means that after an upward difference, the next difference must be downward and vice versa.\n2. **Objective:** Given an array of integers, you need to find the length of its longest wiggle subsequence. A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the original sequence, but the remaining elements should stay in their original order.\n\n**Examples for Clarity:**\n- Example 1: For [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5], the output is 6 because the entire sequence is already a wiggle sequence.\n- Example 2: For [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8], the output is 7 for subsequence [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8].\n- Example 3: For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the output is 2 for subsequence [1, 9].\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem Using Dynamic Programming:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define two arrays `up` and `down`. \n   - `up[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with an upward trend.\n   - `down[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with a downward trend.\n   - Initialize both arrays with `1` because any single element sequence has a wiggle length of `1`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last.\n   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with all preceding elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend a downward trend sequence ending at `j` to an upward trend at `i`. Update `up[i]` as the maximum of `up[i]` and `down[j] + 1`.\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend an upward trend sequence ending at `j` to a downward trend at `i`. Update `down[i]` as the maximum of `down[i]` and `up[j] + 1`.\n   - Update an overall maximum length `ans` by comparing `up[i]` and `down[i]` after each iteration.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The longest wiggle subsequence length will be the maximum value in the last `ans`, which you maintain throughout the iteration.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to nested loops (iterating each element and comparing it with all preceding elements).\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 7, 4]`:\n\n- Initialize `up = [1, 1, 1]` and `down = [1, 1, 1]`.\n- For `i = 1`, compare `nums[1] (7)` with `nums[0] (1)`:\n  - `7 > 1`, so `up[1] = max(up[1], down[0] + 1)` which results in `up[1] = 2`. Update `ans` to 2 since it's the maximum between `up[1]` and `down[1]`.\n- For `i = 2`, compare `nums[2] (4)` with `nums[0] (1)` and `nums[1] (7)`:\n  - `4 > 1`, so nothing changes because `up[2]` remains 1.\n  - `4 < 7`, so `down[2] = max(down[2], up[1] + 1)` which results in `down[2] = 3`. Update `ans` to 3 (now maximum between `up[2]` and `down[2]`).\n\n- The final length is `max(up[2], down[2])`, which is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop a solution to find the longest wiggle subsequence effectively.

Your task is to find two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than `k`, and this sum is the maximum possible. If no such pair exists, you should return `-1`.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Sort the Array:**\n   Begin by sorting the array in ascending order. Sorting will help you efficiently search for the pairs whose sum is closest to, but still less than, `k`.\n\n**Why Sorting Helps:**\n   If the array is sorted, any pair you find later in the array will always have a larger sum compared to pairs earlier on unless they exceed `k`. This makes it easier to track your largest valid sum.\n\n**2. Initialize Variables:**\n   Start by initializing a variable, say `ans`, to hold the maximum valid sum found. Set `ans` to `-1` initially as a default in case no valid pairs are found.\n\n**3. Iterate Through the Array:**\n   Use a loop to iterate through each element `nums[i]` of the array. For each element, you will search for another element `nums[j]` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < k`.\n\n**4. Binary Search for the Closest Pair:**\n   For the current `nums[i]`, you want to find the largest possible `nums[j]` (where `j > i`) such that their sum is less than `k`. To do this efficiently:\n   - Use a binary search to find the position where `nums[j]` would make `nums[i] + nums[j]` closest to `k` without exceeding it.\n   - Specifically, you can look for an element in the range of `nums[i+1:]` (elements after `nums[i]`) that is less than `k - nums[i]`.\n   - The `bisect_left` function from Python\u2019s `bisect` module can help you find this position quickly. Adjust the position found by `bisect_left` to get the actual index of `nums[j]`.\n\n**5. Update the Maximum Sum:**\n   - If you find such a `nums[j]`, compute the sum `nums[i] + nums[j]`.\n   - Check if this sum is greater than the current value of `ans`. If so, update `ans` with this new sum.\n\n**6. Return the Result:**\n   After iterating through all elements and trying to find the optimum pairs, return `ans`.\n\n#### Summary of Algorithm:\n\n1. **Sort the array `nums`.**\n2. **Initialize `ans` to `-1`.**\n3. **For each element `nums[i]`**:\n   - Use binary search to find the largest element `nums[j]` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < k`.\n   - Update `ans` if a new larger valid sum is found.\n4. **Return `ans`.**\n\n#### Example Walk-through:\n\n1. Given `nums = [34, 23, 1, 24, 75, 33, 54, 8]` and `k = 60`:\n   - After sorting, `nums` becomes: `[1, 8, 23, 24, 33, 34, 54, 75]`.\n   - Set `ans = -1`.\n   - Loop through each element:\n     - For `nums[0] = 1`: Find the largest `j` such that `nums[0] + nums[j] < 60`.\n     - Continue similarly for each element.\n     - The best pair is `34 + 24 = 58` which is less than `60`.\n\n2. For `nums = [10, 20, 30]` and `k = 15`:\n   - After sorting, `nums = [10, 20, 30]`.\n   - For any `i`, there\u2019s no `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] < 15`.\n   - Thus, return `-1`.\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to implement a solution that efficiently finds the maximum sum of pairs less than `k`.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def twoSumLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        ans = -1\n        for i, x in enumerate(nums):\n            j = bisect_left(nums, k - x, lo=i + 1) - 1\n            if i < j:\n                ans = max(ans, x + nums[j])\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["two-sum-less-than-k"]}, "2919": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums having length n.\nYou are allowed to perform a special move any number of times (including zero) on nums.

Let's break down the steps you need to follow to solve this problem:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Constraints and Problem Scope\n1. **Palindromic Numbers**: A number is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 121, 333, etc.).\n2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to change `nums[i]` to `x` is `|nums[i] - x|`.\n3. **Goal**: Minimize the total cost of making all elements of `nums` equal to some palindromic number less than 10^9.\n\n#### Step 2: Generate Palindromic Numbers\nGiven the constraint that the palindromic numbers must be less than 10^9, we can generate these numbers systematically:\n- You can generate palindromic numbers by iterating through numbers from `1` to `10^5`.\n- For each number, create two types of palindromes:\n  - **Even Length** Palindromes: Reverse the number and concatenate it to itself (e.g., for `123`, it becomes `123321`).\n  - **Odd Length** Palindromes: Reverse the number excluding its last digit and concatenate (e.g., for `123`, it becomes `12321`).\n\n#### Step 3: Sort the Palindromic Numbers\n- Collect all generated palindromic numbers into an array.\n- Sort this array to enable efficient searching later.\n\n#### Step 4: Find the Median of `nums`\n- Sort the given array `nums`.\n- Identify the median element. For an array of size `n`, the median is located at the index `n // 2`.\n\n#### Step 5: Binary Search for the Closest Palindromic Number\n- Using binary search, locate the palindromic number in the sorted array of palindromic numbers that is closest to the median of `nums`.\n- This ensures minimizing the transformations needed to convert `nums` to a palindromic array.\n\n#### Step 6: Calculate the Minimum Cost\n- Consider the palindromic number identified in the previous step and some neighboring palindromic numbers to ensure you find the minimum cost transformation.\n- Compute the cost of transforming each element in `nums` to each of these candidate palindromic numbers.\n- Return the minimum computed cost.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Execution\n1. **Generate Palindromic Numbers**:\n   - Iterate through numbers from `1` to `10^5`.\n   - Create both even and odd length palindromes.\n   - Store and sort these numbers.\n\n2. **Sort the Input Array**:\n   - Sort the array `nums` to easily find the median.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Optimal Palindrome**:\n   - Use the built median for binary search.\n   - Identify the closest palindromic number and a couple of neighbors for minimal cost calculation.\n\n4. **Calculate and Return the Minimum Cost**:\n   - For each candidate palindromic number, calculate the total cost.\n   - Return the minimum cost found.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\nFor example,\n- `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: After sorting, the median is `3`.\n- The closest palindromic number is `3`.\n- Calculate the transformation cost: `|1-3| + |2-3| + |3-3| + |4-3| + |5-3| = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 6`.\n\nBy following these steps systematically, you'll be able to solve the problem efficiently and find the minimum possible cost of converting an integer array into an equalindromic array.\n\n Solution Code: \nps = []\nfor i in range(1, 10**5 + 1):\n    s = str(i)\n    t1 = s[::-1]\n    t2 = s[:-1][::-1]\n    ps.append(int(s + t1))\n    ps.append(int(s + t2))\nps.sort()\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        def f(x: int) -> int:\n            return sum(abs(v - x) for v in nums)\n\n        nums.sort()\n        i = bisect_left(ps, nums[len(nums) // 2])\n        return min(f(ps[j]) for j in range(i - 1, i + 2) if 0 <= j < len(ps))\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-cost-to-make-array-equalindromic"]}, "2920": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.\nPartition the cards into one or more groups such that:\n\nEach group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and\nAll the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.\n\nReturn true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: No possible partition.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= deck.length <= 104\n0 <= deck[i] < 104\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "2921": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:\n\n'?'

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - Design a function `dfs(i, j)` that will check if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` matches the substring of `p` starting from index `j`.\n   - The result would be stored in a cache to avoid recomputation.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `i` (the current position in `s`) is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, the function should return `True` only if `j` (the current position in `p`) is also at or beyond the end of `p`, or if the remaining characters in `p` are all '*'.\n   - If `j` is beyond the length of `p` but `i` isn't, return `False` since pattern `p` lacks more characters to match with `s`.\n\n3. **Handling '*' Character**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '*', check the following possibilities:\n     - The '*' matches zero characters \u2013 move to the next character in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i, j + 1)`).\n     - The '*' matches one or more characters \u2013 move to the next character in `s` but keep the current position in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j)`) or move to the next character in both `s` and `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n4. **Handling '?' Character or Exact Match**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '?' or the characters in `s` and `p` match, then move to the next characters in both the strings (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n5. **Memoization**:\n   - Use a caching mechanism to store the results of function calls to avoid redundant calculations. This will help in improving the efficiency drastically.\n\n6. **Final Check**:\n   - Begin the recursion from the start of both the strings (i.e., call `dfs(0, 0)`).\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\nYou can summarize the above logic into the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction isMatch(s, p):\n    memo = createEmptyCache()  # Initialize a cache to store results\n\n    Define function dfs(i, j):\n        if i >= length(s):\n            return j >= length(p) OR (p[j] == '*' AND func(i, j + 1))\n        if j >= length(p):\n            return False\n        if p[j] == '*':\n            return dfs(i + 1, j) OR dfs(i + 1, j + 1) OR dfs(i, j + 1)\n        return (p[j] == '?' OR s[i] == p[j]) AND dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n    return dfs(0, 0)\n\nCall isMatch with the strings s and p.\n```\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to construct a solution for the wildcard pattern matching problem by carefully defining and implementing the recursive function `dfs` with memoization. This will ensure you handle all possible pattern matching scenarios efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> bool:\n            if i >= len(s):\n                return j >= len(p) or (p[j] == \"*\" and dfs(i, j + 1))\n            if j >= len(p):\n                return False\n            if p[j] == \"*\":\n                return dfs(i + 1, j) or dfs(i + 1, j + 1) or dfs(i, j + 1)\n            return (p[j] == \"?\" or s[i] == p[j]) and dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n        return dfs(0, 0)\n", "problem_ids": ["wildcard-matching"]}, "2952": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k.\nA subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k.\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array nums.\nA subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2. Initiate the counter and subset count.\n3. Call the `dfs(0)` to start from the first element.\n4. Return the final count of beautiful subsets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution to find all beautiful subsets of the given array.

Your task is to create a new array containing all unique values that appear in at least two of these three arrays. You can return the array in any order.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Inputs and Outputs:**\n   - You have three arrays of integers: `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`.\n   - Each array can contain numbers between 1 and 100.\n   - Your goal is to return an array of numbers that appear in at least two of these arrays. \n\n2. **Convert Arrays to Sets:**\n   - Convert each of the three arrays to sets. This helps in quickly checking the presence of elements and automatically removes any duplicate values within each array.\n\n3. **Enumerate Possible Values:**\n   - Since the array values are bounded between 1 and 100, you can iterate through this range and check if a number is present in at least two of the sets.\n\n4. **Check for Common Values:**\n   - For each number from 1 to 100, check if it appears in at least two of the three sets. \n   - If a number satisfies this condition, add it to your result list.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - Once you've iterated through the possible values and collected all the numbers that appear in at least two arrays, return this list as your result.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Convert to Sets:**\n   - Convert `nums1` to a set called `s1`.\n   - Convert `nums2` to a set called `s2`.\n   - Convert `nums3` to a set called `s3`.\n\n2. **Initialize Result List:**\n   - Create an empty list, say `result`, to store the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n3. **Enumerate and Check:**\n   - Iterate through each number `i` from 1 to 100:\n     - Check if `i` is in `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`.\n     - Use logical conditions to count how many of the sets contain `i`.\n     - If `i` is found in at least two of these sets, add `i` to `result`.\n\n4. **Return the Result List:**\n   - After completing the iteration, return the `result` list.\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3` to sets:\n   ```\n   s1 = set(nums1)\n   s2 = set(nums2)\n   s3 = set(nums3)\n   ```\n2. Initialize the result list:\n   ```\n   result = []\n   ```\n3. Iterate through numbers 1 to 100:\n   ```\n   for i in range(1, 101):\n       count = 0\n       if i in s1:\n           count += 1\n       if i in s2:\n           count += 1\n       if i in s3:\n           count += 1\n       \n       if count >= 2:\n           result.append(i)\n   ```\n4. Return the result list:\n   ```\n   return result\n   ```\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Sets**: Using sets helps in efficiently managing and checking for the presence of elements.\n- **Iteration**: Iterating from 1 to 100 ensures you cover all possible values within the given constraints.\n- **Condition Checking**: Counting the presence of each number in the three sets allows you to determine if a number should be included in the result.\n\nFollowing these steps systematically will help you solve the problem efficiently.

Let's break down the problem and our approach to solving it step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou have an integer array `nums` and you need to find the \"beauty\" of each subarray of a given size `k`. The beauty of a subarray is defined as the `x`th smallest negative integer within that subarray. If a subarray has fewer than `x` negative integers, the beauty is `0`.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Use a Sliding Window\n\nThe main technique you will use here is called the \"sliding window\". This means you will continuously move a window of size `k` across the array to examine every contiguous subarray of length `k`.\n\n#### 2. Count Array\n\nGiven the range of integers in `nums` is from `-50` to `50`, you can use an array of fixed size `101` to count the occurrences of each integer. This works because you can shift all values by adding 50 to make them fit within the range `0` to `100`.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. **Initialize Count Array:**\n   - Create an array `cnt` of size `101` to store the count of each number in the range `-50` to `50`. \n   - Initialize all elements of `cnt` to zero.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Window:**\n   - For the first subarray of size `k` in `nums`, update the `cnt` array by incrementing the count at the index corresponding to each number in the subarray (Remember to shift each number by adding 50).\n\n3. **Function to Find xth Smallest Negative:**\n   - Write a helper function that scans through the `cnt` array to find the `x`th smallest negative number. This can be done by traversing through the first `50` elements of `cnt` (which corresponds to numbers from `-50` to `-1` after shifting).\n\n4. **Sliding the Window:**\n   - Start sliding the window from the beginning of the array to the end:\n     - For each new iteration, add the next number coming into the window to the `cnt` array.\n     - Remove the number that is sliding out of the window from the `cnt` array.\n     - Use the helper function to determine the beauty value for the current window and store it in the result list.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - Once you have slid the window across the entire array, return the list of beauty values.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's go through an example to clarify the process:\n\n**Example:**\nInput: `nums = [1, -1, -3, -2, 3]`, `k = 3`, `x = 2`\n\n1. **Initialize `cnt`:**\n   - `cnt` is an array of size `101` all set to `0`.\n\n2. **First Window `[1, -1, -3]`:**\n   - Convert to indices: `[1+50, -1+50, -3+50]` => `[51, 49, 47]`.\n   - Update `cnt`: `cnt[51] = 1`, `cnt[49] = 1`, `cnt[47] = 1`.\n\n3. **Calculate Beauty for First Window:**\n   - Traverse first `50` elements in `cnt` to find the 2nd smallest negative integer.\n   - 2nd smallest negative: `-1`.\n\n4. **Move Window to Next Position `[ -1, -3, -2 ]`:**\n   - Add `-2+50` => `48` to `cnt`.\n   - Remove `1+50` => `51` from `cnt`.\n   - Update `cnt`: `cnt[49] = 1`, `cnt[47] = 1`, `cnt[48] = 1`, `cnt[51] = 0`.\n\n5. **Calculate Beauty for Second Window:**\n   - Traverse `cnt` again.\n   - 2nd smallest negative: `-2`.\n\n6. **Continue Sliding the Window:**\n   - Follow the same steps, move to next window `[ -3, -2, 3 ]`.\n   - Update counts and find the 2nd smallest negative integer for each window position until the end of the array.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to find the beauty values for every subarray of size `k` within the array. This approach ensures you efficiently manage the counting and determination using the sliding window technique and a count array to keep track of number occurrences. This method is efficient and works well within the given problem constraints.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def getSubarrayBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        def f(x: int) -> int:\n            s = 0\n            for i in range(50):\n                s += cnt[i]\n                if s >= x:\n                    return i - 50\n            return 0\n\n        cnt = [0] * 101\n        for v in nums[:k]:\n            cnt[v + 50] += 1\n        ans = [f(x)]\n        for i in range(k, len(nums)):\n            cnt[nums[i] + 50] += 1\n            cnt[nums[i - k] + 50] -= 1\n            ans.append(f(x))\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["sliding-subarray-beauty"]}, "2955": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer n and an integer start.\nDefine an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2 * i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.\nReturn the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, start = 0\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.\nWhere \"^\" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, start = 3\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= start <= 1000\nn == nums.length\n\n Solution: \n## How to Solve the XOR Operation Problem: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIn this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to solve a problem involving the bitwise XOR operation on elements of an array. Let's break down the problem and tackle it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given two integers, `n` and `start`. Using these, you need to construct an array `nums` where each element is defined as follows:\n- `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (where `i` is the index of the element, starting from 0).\n\nFor instance, if `n = 5` and `start = 0`:\n- `nums` would be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n\nYour task is to return the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the `nums` array. \n\nBitwise XOR is a binary operation that follows these rules:\n- 0 XOR 0 = 0\n- 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nFollow the steps below to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize an Array to Store the Elements**: \n\n   Create an array `nums` where each element is calculated using the formula `nums[i] = start + 2 * i`. This array is defined for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Element**:\n\n   Iterate through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and calculate the value of `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Compute the XOR for All Elements**:\n\n   Initialize a variable to store the XOR result. As you iterate over the elements of the array, update this variable by XORing it with each element. This can be done using a loop.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Create the Array**:\n   - Declare an array called `nums` with a length of `n`.\n   - Loop from `0` to `n-1` to fill the array, where each element `nums[i]` is calculated as `start + 2 * i`.\n\n2. **Calculate XOR**:\n   - Initialize a variable, say `xor_result`, to `0`. This will store our final XOR result.\n   - Loop through the `nums` array and update `xor_result` by performing the XOR operation with each `nums[i]`. Essentially, `xor_result` becomes `xor_result ^ nums[i]` for each element `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, the variable `xor_result` will contain the final XOR result of all elements in the array.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's consider an example to make the explanation clearer.\n\n**Example 1**:\n- Input: `n = 5`, `start = 0`\n- Create the array `nums`:\n  - When `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 0 + 2 * 0 = 0`\n  - When `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2`\n  - When `i = 2`, `nums[2] = 0 + 2 * 2 = 4`\n  - When `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 0 + 2 * 3 = 6`\n  - When `i = 4`, `nums[4] = 0 + 2 * 4 = 8`\n- The array `nums` will be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n- Calculate the XOR of all elements:\n  - `result = 0 ^ 0 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 2 = 2`\n  - `result = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n  - `result = 6 ^ 6 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 8 = 8`\n- The final result is `8`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem and find the XOR of all elements in the `nums` array.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:\n        return reduce(xor, ((start + 2 * i) for i in range(n)))\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-operation-in-an-array"]}, "2977": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two string arrays, queries and dictionary.

Each word is composed of lowercase English letters and has the same fixed length across both lists. Our task is to find all words in `queries` that can be converted into any word in `dictionary` with at most two letter changes. We need to return these words in the same order they appear in `queries`.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Both `queries` and `dictionary` contain words of the same length.\n   - We can change any letter in a word from `queries` to any other letter, and we need to determine if it can match a word from `dictionary` with at most two such changes.\n   - The goal is to return a list of words from `queries` that meet this criterion.\n\n2. **Plan the Solution:**\n   - For each word in `queries`, compare it with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - Count the number of differing letters between each pair of words.\n   - If the count of differing letters is less than or equal to two, record the word from `queries`.\n\n3. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the words from `queries` that can match with words from `dictionary` with up to two edits.\n   - Use nested loops to compare each word in `queries` with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - For this comparison, iterate through the letters of both words simultaneously and count the differences.\n   - If the differences are two or fewer, add the word from `queries` to the result list and break out of the inner loop (since one match is enough).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations:**\n   - The time complexity is determined by the number of comparisons we make between the words.\n   - Each word comparison takes linear time relative to the word length.\n   - Given that the lengths of `queries` and `dictionary` can each be up to 100 and the word length can be up to 100, ensure your approach can handle the worst-case scenario efficiently.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider the following example:\n```python\nqueries = [\"word\", \"note\", \"ants\", \"wood\"]\ndictionary = [\"wood\", \"joke\", \"moat\"]\n```\n- Compare \"word\" with \"wood\": One edit needed ('r' to 'o'), so \"word\" matches.\n- Compare \"note\" with \"joke\": Two edits needed ('n' to 'j' and 't' to 'k'), so \"note\" matches.\n- Compare \"ants\" with all dictionary words: Requires more than two edits for each, so \"ants\" does not match.\n- Compare \"wood\" with \"wood\": No edits needed, so \"wood\" matches.\n\nThus, the output is `[\"word\", \"note\", \"wood\"]`.\n\n#### Algorithm Pseudocode:\n\n```text\ninitialize an empty list result\n\nfor each word s in queries:\n    for each word t in dictionary:\n        count differences between s and t\n        if differences are <= 2:\n            add s to result\n            break out of inner loop\n\nreturn result\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Ensure you correctly understand how to count the number of letter differences between two words efficiently.\n- Be mindful of the break condition in the inner loop \u2013 it helps avoid unnecessary comparisons once a match is found.\n- Use list comprehensions and Python's built-in functions efficiently for counting and managing iterations.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to implement a solution that identifies all words in `queries` that can be transformed into any word in `dictionary` with at most two edits.

Let's break down the process of solving this problem into clear steps. Imagine you are guiding a student step-by-step through the solution. Here's how you could approach it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Maximum Possible Total Damage Problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:\n    - You're given an array where each element represents the damage of a spell.\n    - If you cast a spell with damage `power[i]`, you can't cast any spells with damages `power[i] - 2`, `power[i] - 1`, `power[i] + 1`, or `power[i] + 2`.\n    - Your task is to find the maximum possible total damage by selecting an optimal subset of spells.\n\n2. **Initial Considerations**:\n    - Notice the problem constraint and the challenge involved in ensuring no two selected spells are in conflict in terms of their damage values.\n    - Plan to use a combination of sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming with memoization to achieve an efficient solution.\n\n3. **Sorting and Counting**:\n    - **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. Sorting helps you manage the selection process efficiently.\n    - **Count Occurrences**: Use a hash table (like Python\u2019s Counter) to count the occurrences of each damage value. This helps in efficiently managing multiples of the same damage.\n\n4. **Determine Next Valid Index**:\n    - For each damage value, you need to determine the first index in the sorted array that holds a value greater than the current damage plus 2 (`power[i] + 2`). This helps in avoiding invalid selections. Use binary search to find this index efficiently.\n    - Store these indices in an array, which we'll call `nxt`.\n\n5. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:\n    - Define a function (`dfs`) that calculates the maximum damage starting from the `i`-th index.\n    - In the `dfs` function, you have two choices:\n        1. **Skip Current Damage**: Skip all occurrences of the current damage and move to the next index that follows these occurrences.\n        2. **Use Current Damage**: Use all occurrences of the current damage and move to the next valid index found using the `nxt` array.\n    - Recursively compute the maximum possible damage for both choices and take the higher of the two.\n\n6. **Memoization**:\n    - To avoid recalculating the results for the same indices multiple times, store the results in a memoization table. Typically, you can use a list where each index stores the result of `dfs` starting from that index.\n\n7. **Calculate Maximum Damage**:\n    - Start the `dfs` function from the first index (0) and use it to calculate the maximum possible total damage.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\nConsider the `power` array `[1, 1, 3, 4]`:\n1. **Sort and Count**:\n    - Sorted array: `[1, 1, 3, 4]`\n    - Count occurrences: `{1: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`\n2. **Next Valid Index**:\n    - For `1`: Next value greater than `1+2` (3) is 3 (index 2)\n    - For `3`: Next value greater than `3+2` (5) is beyond the array (index 4)\n    - For `4`: Next value greater than `4+2` (6) is beyond the array (index 4)\n3. **DFS Approach**:\n    - Start from index 0.\n    - Either skip the value `1` and start from index 2 (`3`), or use all `1`s (total 2 damage) and move to index 2.\n    - Similarly make decisions at subsequent steps and compute the maximum damage.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you will efficiently solve the problem while handling all constraints and maximizing the total damage output.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maximumTotalDamage(self, power: List[int]) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int) -> int:\n            if i >= n:\n                return 0\n            a = dfs(i + cnt[power[i]])\n            b = power[i] * cnt[power[i]] + dfs(nxt[i])\n            return max(a, b)\n\n        n = len(power)\n        cnt = Counter(power)\n        power.sort()\n        nxt = [bisect_right(power, x + 2, lo=i + 1) for i, x in enumerate(power)]\n        return dfs(0)\n", "problem_ids": ["maximum-total-damage-with-spell-casting"]}, "2998": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nLet's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.\nGiven two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: left = \"4\", right = \"1000\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.\nNote that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: left = \"1\", right = \"2\"\nOutput: 1\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18\nleft and right consist of only digits.\nleft and right cannot have leading zeros.\nleft and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018 - 1].\nleft is less than or equal to right.\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Super-Palindrome Problem\n\nTo tackle the problem of finding super-palindromes within a specified range, follow these systematic steps:\n\n#### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n1. **Palindrome**: A number that reads the same backward as forward. Examples include 121, 484, etc.\n2. **Super-Palindrome**: A number which is both a palindrome and the square of another number that is also a palindrome.\n\n#### **Step 2: Set Constraints and Limits**\nRecognize the given constraints:\n- The range [left, right] is in the form of strings, representing integers up to 10^18.\n- The numbers have no leading zeros.\n\n#### **Step 3: Generate Palindromes**\n1. Generate possible candidates for the palindromic number \\( p \\) such that \\( p^2 \\) lies within the range [1, 10^18).\n2. Palindromic numbers \\( p \\) must be in the range [1, 10^9), as their squares must stay within the boundary of 10^18.\n\n#### **Step 4: Generate All Possible Palindromic Numbers**\n1. To generate palindromic numbers efficiently, create palindromes by building numbers from half their digits and mirroring these halves.\n2. For instance, take a number `i` and reverse it to append to the number itself to form both even and odd-length palindromes.\n\n#### **Step 5: Square Palindromic Numbers**\n1. For each palindrome \\( p \\) generated:\n    - Compute \\( p^2 \\).\n    - Check if \\( p^2 \\) sits within the desired range [left, right].\n \n#### **Step 6: Check for Super-Palindromes**\n1. Ensure that \\( p^2 \\) is also a palindrome.\n2. Iterate through each \\( p^2 \\) to confirm if it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n#### **Step 7: Count Valid Super-Palindromes**\n1. Track and count each valid super-palindrome that meets all the above criteria.\n\n#### **Detailed Steps**\n\n1. **Generating Palindromes**:\n   - **Even-Length Palindromes**: For a number `s`, form the palindrome by appending its reverse to itself, like `s + reverse(s)`.\n   - **Odd-Length Palindromes**: For a number `s`, form by appending its reverse minus the last digit, like `s + reverse(s[:-1])`.\n\n2. **Check if a Number is a Palindrome**:\n   - Reverse the number and check if it matches the original number.\n   \n3. **Enumerate Possible Palindromes**:\n   - Start with small numbers and progressively build larger palindromes up to the limit (10^9).\n\n4. **Filter and Count Super-Palindromes**:\n   - For each candidate palindrome `p`, square it and check:\n     - If the squared value lies within your target range.\n     - If the squared value remains a palindrome when its digits are reversed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can identify all super-palindromes within any given range. This approach leverages both the properties of palindromes and efficient generation techniques to address the problem systematically.

Each sublist will hold characters that belong to a specific row.\n   - Initialize variables:\n     - `i`: Tracks the current row index.\n     - `k`: A direction indicator (initially set to `-1` to represent upward movement).\n   - Traverse the string character by character. Append each character to the appropriate row in `g` based on the current value of `i`.\n\n4. **Direction Control:**\n   - Adjust the value of `i` and `k` to simulate the zigzag movement:\n     - If you are at the top row (`i == 0`) or the bottom row (`i == numRows - 1`), reverse the direction (`k = -k`).\n     - Update `i` by adding `k` (move up or down accordingly).\n\n5. **Collect the Result:**\n   - Once all characters have been added to the appropriate rows, concatenate all rows to form the final string by joining all sublists in `g`.\n\n#### Detailed Steps for Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a list of `numRows` empty lists (`g`).\n   - Set `i` to `0` (starting at the first row).\n   - Set `k` to `-1` (initial direction is upward).\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String:**\n   - For each character in the string:\n     - Append the character to the current row (`g[i]`).\n     - If you are at the first row (`i == 0`) or the last row (`i == numRows - 1`), multiply `k` by `-1` to change direction.\n     - Increment or decrement `i` by `k` to move to the next row accordingly.\n\n3. **Concatenate Rows:**\n   - After all characters are processed, each sublist in `g` contains the characters of a zigzag row.\n   - Combine all sublists into a single string and return this as the result.\n\n### Example to Clarify the Process\n\nLet's take an example to clarify:\n\n**Input:** `s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4`\n\n1. **Pattern Formation:**\n\n   ```\n   P     I    N\n   A   L S  I G\n   Y A   H R\n   P     I\n   ```\n\n2. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Initialize `g` with 4 empty lists.\n   - Traverse the string and distribute characters according to the zigzag pattern:\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 0.\n     - Traverse \"A\", add to row 1.\n     - Traverse \"Y\", add to row 2.\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 3 (Reverse direction here).\n     - Continue following the described rules.\n\n3. **Result Compilation:**\n   - After processing all characters, concatenate the rows:\n     ```\n     P + I + N + A + L + S + I + G + Y + A + H + R + P + I  => \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\n     ```\n   - Return the concatenated string as the final output.\n\n### Summary\nBy systematically simulating the zigzag pattern, updating row indices, and reversing direction at appropriate points, you can effectively convert the given string to the required format and compile the final output.

Your task is to find the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < j <= n - 1` and:\n\n\\[ nums1[i] - nums1[j] \\leq nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff \\]\n\n#### Key Observations:\n1. **Transformation of the Inequality:** \n   The given inequality \\( nums1[i] - nums1[j] \\leq nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff \\) can be transformed to:\n   \\[ nums1[i] - nums2[i] \\leq nums1[j] - nums2[j] + diff \\]\n   This means we need to calculate a new array \\( \\text{nums} \\) where:\n   \\[ \\text{nums}[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i] \\]\n   \n   The problem then becomes finding the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:\n   \\[ \\text{nums}[i] \\leq \\text{nums}[j] + diff \\]\n\n2. **Enumeration and Counting:** \n   We should enumerate `j` from smaller to larger indices and count how many numbers before `j` satisfy the condition \\( \\text{nums}[i] \\leq \\text{nums}[j] + diff \\).\n\n#### Efficient Counting Technique:\nTo efficiently count such pairs, we can utilize a **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)** to maintain the count of elements:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Create a BIT to keep track of frequencies of elements we have seen so far.\n   - Define a sufficiently large offset (say 40000) to handle negative values and to keep the indices within a manageable range (as BITs generally require positive indices).\n\n2. **BIT Operations:**\n   - **Update Operation:** When we encounter a new value in `nums`, we update its frequency in the BIT.\n   - **Query Operation:** To count how many values before the current index fulfill the condition \\( \\text{nums}[i] \\leq \\text{nums}[j] + diff \\), we query the BIT up to the adjusted value `current_value + diff`.\n\n#### Steps to Implement:\n1. **Compute the `nums` array:** \n   - Iterate over `nums1` and `nums2` and compute `nums[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i]`.\n\n2. **Setup the BIT:**\n   - Initialize a BIT with a size large enough to accommodate all possible values.\n\n3. **Enumerate and Count:**\n   - For each index `j` in `nums`:\n     - Use the BIT to count how many elements before `j` fulfill the condition.\n     - Update the BIT with the current value in `nums`.\n\n4. **Returning the Count:** \n   - Continue the above process for all indices to accumulate the total count of valid pairs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem and count the number of pairs that satisfy the given condition. Remember, the key idea is to transform the problem into a form where we can use efficient data structures like BIT to manage and query the necessary counts within logarithmic time complexity.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass BinaryIndexedTree:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.n = n\n        self.c = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def lowbit(x):\n        return x & -x\n\n    def update(self, x, delta):\n        while x <= self.n:\n            self.c[x] += delta\n            x += BinaryIndexedTree.lowbit(x)\n\n    def query(self, x):\n        s = 0\n        while x:\n            s += self.c[x]\n            x -= BinaryIndexedTree.lowbit(x)\n        return s\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfPairs(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], diff: int) -> int:\n        tree = BinaryIndexedTree(10**5)\n        ans = 0\n        for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2):\n            v = a - b\n            ans += tree.query(v + diff + 40000)\n            tree.update(v + 40000, 1)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["number-of-pairs-satisfying-inequality"]}, "3017": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a binary array nums.\nA subarray of an array is good if it contains exactly one element with the value 1.\nReturn an integer denoting the number of ways to split the array nums into good subarrays.

Let's break down the process of solving this problem with a clear, step-by-step guide.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou are given a binary array `nums` consisting of 0s and 1s. A subarray is considered \"good\" if it contains exactly one element with the value 1. Your task is to determine the number of possible ways to split the array into such good subarrays. The result should be returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) due to potential large results.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Identify Important Points (1s) in the Array:** \n   - Iterate through the array and identify the indices of all the 1s. These indices will help us understand potential \"split points.\"\n\n2. **Handle the Case of No 1s:**\n   - If the array contains no 1s, it is not possible to create any good subarrays, so the answer should be 0 immediately.\n\n3. **Calculate Splits Using the Multiplication Principle:**\n   - For each pair of consecutive 1s found in the array, calculate the number of possible split points between them. This can be determined by looking at the distance between consecutive 1s.\n   - Multiply these distances together to get the total number of ways to split the array.\n\n4. **Handle Large Numbers (Modulo Operation):**\n   - Since the number of splits can be very large, we need to return the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Set a variable `mod` to \\(10^9 + 7\\) for the modulo operation.\n   - Initialize `ans` to 1, which will hold the final number of ways to split, starting from a neutral value that won't affect multiplication.\n   - Use another variable `last_index_of_1` to keep track of the last seen position of a 1 in the array, initially set it to -1 to indicate no 1s have been seen yet.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the Array:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through the array. For each element in the array:\n     - If the element is a 0, continue to the next element.\n     - If the element is a 1:\n       - Check if you have seen a 1 before (`last_index_of_1` != -1).\n       - If you have, calculate the number of ways to split the array between the last 1 and the current 1, which is the distance between their indices.\n       - Multiply `ans` by this distance and take modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n       - Update `last_index_of_1` to the current index of the 1.\n\n3. **Final Check:**\n   - After the loop, if `last_index_of_1` is still -1, it means the array had no 1s at all, so return 0.\n   - Otherwise, return the value of `ans`.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nConsider the array `nums = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`.\n\n- Initialize `ans = 1` and `last_index_of_1 = -1`.\n- Iterate through the array:\n  - At index 0: Element is 0, continue.\n  - At index 1: Element is 1, set `last_index_of_1` to 1.\n  - At index 2: Element is 0, continue.\n  - At index 3: Element is 0, continue.\n  - At index 4: Element is 1:\n    - Calculate distance to last index of 1: \\(4 - 1 = 3\\).\n    - Multiply `ans` by 3: `ans = 1 * 3 = 3`.\n    - Update `last_index_of_1` to 4.\n\nThe final value of `ans` is 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can efficiently solve the problem of finding the number of ways to split the array into good subarrays. The key is to leverage the distances between consecutive 1s and to handle potential large outputs using the modulo operation.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfGoodSubarraySplits(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        ans, j = 1, -1\n        for i, x in enumerate(nums):\n            if x == 0:\n                continue\n            if j > -1:\n                ans = ans * (i - j) % mod\n            j = i\n        return 0 if j == -1 else ans\n", "problem_ids": ["ways-to-split-array-into-good-subarrays"]}, "3018": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths.

Let's walk through the steps needed to solve the problem of determining if a given string matches its abbreviation. To make this process easier, we'll go step-by-step and use clear explanations to help you understand the logic behind the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solving the Problem\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**:\n    - You are given two strings: `word` and `abbr`.\n    - The string `abbr` is an abbreviation of `word` and may contain both letters and numbers.\n    - Numbers in `abbr` indicate the count of contiguous characters from `word` that can be replaced by that number.\n    - You need to determine if `word` can be matched by the abbreviation `abbr` based on the given rules.\n\n2. **Validations and Constraints**:\n    - The string `abbr` should not have leading zeros.\n    - The numbers in `abbr` cannot represent adjacent characters.\n    - You should ensure there are no empty substrings being replaced by numbers.\n  \n3. **Variables Setup**:\n    - Assign `m` to the length of `word`.\n    - Assign `n` to the length of `abbr`.\n    - Use pointers `i` and `j` starting at the beginning of `word` and `abbr` respectively.\n    - Use a variable `x` to keep track of the current number we are processing in `abbr`.\n\n4. **Processing the Abbreviation**:\n    - Loop through both `word` and `abbr` simultaneously using `i` and `j` as pointers.\n\n5. **Check for Digits in Abbreviation**:\n    - If the character in `abbr` at position `j` is a digit, check if it is '0' and `x` is 0. If true, return false because leading zeros are not allowed.\n    - Update `x` by shifting its current value left by one digit (multiplying `x` by 10) and adding the new digit from `abbr`.\n\n6. **Check for Letters in Abbreviation**:\n    - If the character in `abbr` at position `j` is not a digit, it should be a letter.\n    - Before comparing letters, advance the pointer `i` by the count stored in `x` because `x` counts the number of characters skipped.\n    - Reset `x` to 0 after advancing `i`.\n    - Check if the current character in `word` at the incremented pointer `i` matches the character in `abbr`. If not, return false.\n  \n7. **Synchronize Pointers**:\n    - Move both `i` and `j` forward by one position after processing the current character or number.\n\n8. **Check for Completion**:\n    - After exiting the loop, calculate the final position by adding `x` to `i`. \n    - Make sure `i` plus `x` equals `m` (length of `word`) and `j` equals `n` (length of `abbr`). If both conditions hold, return true.\n\n9. **Edge Cases**:\n    - Ensure there\u2019s no leading zero in any number in `abbr`.\n    - Handle situations where `abbr` might end in a digit by using the variable `x` appropriately.\n\n10. **Final Check**:\n    - Ensure both `i`, updated with `x`, and `j` have traversed the entire lengths of `word` and `abbr` respectively by the end of processing.\n\nBy following these steps, you are simulating how `abbr` can abbreviate `word` and checking if `word` indeed matches that abbreviation according to the rules set out.\n\nI hope this breakdown helps you understand the logic needed to determine if the given word matches its abbreviation!

This way, you can handle each word individually.\n\n3. **Count the Frequency of Each Word:**\n   - Use a mechanism to count how many times each word appears across both sentences. A hash table (dictionary) is the perfect data structure for this because it allows you to keep track of counts efficiently.\n\n4. **Combine the Word Counts:**\n   - Once you have two separate lists of word counts (one for each sentence), combine these counts into a single hash table where the keys are words and the values are their total counts across both sentences.\n\n5. **Identify Uncommon Words:**\n   - Loop through the combined word count table and identify the words that have a count of exactly 1. These are the words that appear exactly once in one of the sentences and not at all in the other.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Splitting the Sentences:**\n   - Use a splitting function to divide each sentence into a list of its component words. For example, the sentence \"this is an example\" becomes the list `[\"this\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\"]`.\n\n2. **Counting Word Frequencies:**\n   - Using a hash table (or dictionary), iterate over the list of words for each sentence and update the count for each word. For instance, if a word appears twice in the sentence, its count will be 2 in the hash table.\n\n3. **Combining Counts:**\n   - To combine the word counts from both sentences, you can merge the two dictionaries. Add the counts of the same words from both sentences.\n\n4. **Extracting Uncommon Words:**\n   - Once you have the combined word frequencies in a single hash table, go through each word and check its count. If the count is exactly 1, it means the word is uncommon.\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Use Built-in Functions:**\n   - Many programming languages offer built-in functions for splitting strings into words and counting occurrences, making your task much easier. For example, Python provides methods like `split()` for splitting and `Counter` from the collections module for counting.\n\n- **Edge Cases:**\n   - Consider cases where sentences might have repeat words or no uncommon words at all. Ensure your solution gracefully handles these scenarios.\n\n### Example:\n\nConsider the following two sentences:\n- s1 = \"this apple is sweet\"\n- s2 = \"this apple is sour\"\n\nFollowing the steps:\n1. Split each sentence into words.\n    - s1: `[\"this\", \"apple\", \"is\", \"sweet\"]`\n    - s2: `[\"this\", \"apple\", \"is\", \"sour\"]`\n2. Count the frequencies:\n    - s1 frequencies: `{\"this\": 1, \"apple\": 1, \"is\": 1, \"sweet\": 1}`\n    - s2 frequencies: `{\"this\": 1, \"apple\": 1, \"is\": 1, \"sour\": 1}`\n3. Combine the counts:\n    - Combined frequencies: `{\"this\": 2, \"apple\": 2, \"is\": 2, \"sweet\": 1, \"sour\": 1}`\n4. Identify uncommon words:\n    - Words with count 1: `[\"sweet\", \"sour\"]`\n\nThus, the result is `[\"sweet\", \"sour\"]`.\n\nBy following these steps methodically, you can resolve the problem and extract the list of uncommon words efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def uncommonFromSentences(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> List[str]:\n        cnt = Counter(s1.split()) + Counter(s2.split())\n        return [s for s, v in cnt.items() if v == 1]\n", "problem_ids": ["uncommon-words-from-two-sentences"]}, "3024": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2).

Points are awarded as follows:\n\n- **5 points** if the student's answer is exactly correct.\n- **2 points** if the student's answer is a valid result of the expression assuming they misinterpreted the order.\n- **0 points** if neither of the above conditions are met.\n\nYou need to compute the total points awarded to the students based on these rules.\n\n#### Breakdown of Solution Approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the Correct Answer:**\n    - Implement a function that evaluates the given string `s` correctly following the specified order: first calculate all multiplications, then additions.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming to Find All Valid Results:**\n    - Use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to store all possible results of sub-expressions in a 2D table `f[i][j]`, where `f[i][j]` stores all possible results from calculating the expression between the `i`-th and `j`-th digits.\n   \n3. **Fill DP Table:**\n    - Initialize the DP table for single digits.\n    - For larger sub-expressions, compute results using previously computed values from smaller sub-expressions, considering all possible places where the expression can be split.\n\n4. **Compute Student Points:**\n    - Check each student's answer against the correct answer.\n    - If it matches, award 5 points.\n    - If it doesn't match but is in the list of possible results (from the DP table), award 2 points.\n    - Otherwise, award 0 points.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Correct Answer:**\n    - Traverse the string `s` and compute the result by:\n      - Multiplying numbers together whenever a `*` is encountered.\n      - Adding the results of multiplications when a `+` is encountered.\n\n2. **Initialize and Fill DP Table:**\n    - Use a 2D list `f` initialized to store sets of possible results for each sub-expression.\n    - For single-digit sub-expressions, simply store the digit itself.\n    - For larger sub-expressions:\n      - Break the expression at each possible point, applying the operator between the resulting sub-expressions.\n      - Store all valid results considering each operation result must not exceed `1000`.\n\n3. **Evaluate Student Answers:**\n    - Use a counter to tally how many times each answer appears in `answers`.\n    - For each answer, check if it matches the correct answer or is in the list of valid sub-expression results.\n    - Sum up the points based on the points criteria given.\n\nUsing this detailed structured approach helps in solving the problem efficiently by breaking it down into manageable parts and utilizing dynamic programming to handle sub-expression calculations effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def scoreOfStudents(self, s: str, answers: List[int]) -> int:\n        def cal(s: str) -> int:\n            res, pre = 0, int(s[0])\n            for i in range(1, n, 2):\n                if s[i] == \"*\":\n                    pre *= int(s[i + 1])\n                else:\n                    res += pre\n                    pre = int(s[i + 1])\n            res += pre\n            return res\n\n        n = len(s)\n        x = cal(s)\n        m = (n + 1) >> 1\n        f = [[set() for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(m)]\n        for i in range(m):\n            f[i][i] = {int(s[i << 1])}\n        for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):\n            for j in range(i, m):\n                for k in range(i, j):\n                    for l in f[i][k]:\n                        for r in f[k + 1][j]:\n                            if s[k << 1 | 1] == \"+\" and l + r <= 1000:\n                                f[i][j].add(l + r)\n                            elif s[k << 1 | 1] == \"*\" and l * r <= 1000:\n                                f[i][j].add(l * r)\n        cnt = Counter(answers)\n        ans = cnt[x] * 5\n        for k, v in cnt.items():\n            if k != x and k in f[0][m - 1]:\n                ans += v << 1\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["the-score-of-students-solving-math-expression"]}, "3025": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums consisting of non-negative integers.\nWe define the score of subarray nums[l..r] such that l <= r as nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] AND ...

Your goal is to split this array into one or more contiguous subarrays such that:\n1. Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.\n2. The sum of the \"scores\" of each subarray is minimized. The score of a subarray is defined as the bitwise AND of all its elements.\n\nYou need to determine the maximum number of subarrays you can achieve while satisfying these conditions.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n- **Bitwise AND Operation**: The bitwise AND operation between two integers results in a number where each bit is 1 if, and only if, the corresponding bits of both operands are 1.\n- **Subarray**: A contiguous section of an array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3]` and `[1, 2]` are subarrays.\n\n#### Plan and Strategy\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a `score` variable with a special value (e.g., -1). This variable keeps track of the score of the current subarray you are building.\n2. **Traversal and Bitwise AND**: Traverse through the array. For each element, perform a bitwise AND operation between the current `score` and the current element.\n3. **Splitting Condition**: If the `score` becomes zero, this means the current subarray's score is minimized (since zero is the smallest possible result of any bitwise AND). Split the subarray here and reset the `score`.\n4. **Counting Subarrays**: Maintain a counter for the number of subarrays. Every time you split the array (when `score` = 0), increment the counter.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n    - A `score` variable to keep track of the AND result of the current subarray. Start it with a value that will make the initial AND operation straightforward (like -1, since ANDing any number with -1 returns the number itself).\n    - An `ans` variable to count the number of subarrays. Start with 1 since there is at least one subarray (the whole array).\n\n2. **Traverse Through Array Elements**:\n    - For each element in the array, update the `score` by performing a bitwise AND operation with the current element.\n    - If at any point `score` becomes 0, it means we have minimized the score for the current subarray. This is the point to split and start a new subarray.\n    - Reset the `score` to -1 to begin the next subarray.\n\n3. **Check for Results**:\n    - After traversing the array, you will have the count of how many times you were able to split the array.\n    - There is a special case: if the array was never split (you only have one subarray), ensure that your answer reflects it appropriately. \n\n4. **Return the Count**:\n    - Return the total number of subarrays that achieve the minimum possible score sum. Remember to adjust the answer if it reflects the count in a different indexing base.\n\nWith these steps in mind, you should be able to implement the logic to solve the problem effectively. The approach is both efficient in terms of time complexity (O(n)) and space complexity (O(1)), as it only requires a single pass through the array and maintains a constant amount of additional storage.\n\nBy following this guide, you should be able to develop a correct and efficient solution to the problem.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        score, ans = -1, 1\n        for num in nums:\n            score &= num\n            if score == 0:\n                score = -1\n                ans += 1\n        return 1 if ans == 1 else ans - 1\n", "problem_ids": ["split-array-into-maximum-number-of-subarrays"]}, "3031": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an m x n binary matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (occupied).\nYou are then given stamps of size stampHeight x stampWidth.

Here's a detailed guide to solving the problem of determining whether it's possible to fit stamps in a given binary grid while adhering to the specified restrictions and requirements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**\n    - You are given a binary matrix (grid) where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (occupied).\n    - You need to place stamps of a given size (stampHeight x stampWidth) such that:\n        - All empty cells (0s) are covered by stamps.\n        - No occupied cell (1s) should be covered by stamps.\n        - Stamps cannot be rotated.\n        - Stamps must fully fit within the boundaries of the grid.\n        - Stamps can overlap with each other.\n\n2. **Key Concepts:**\n    - **Prefix Sum:** A technique to quickly calculate the sum of elements in a sub-array.\n    - **Difference Array:** A way to efficiently apply range updates and then get the final values by applying prefix sum.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n\n#### Part 1: Calculate Prefix Sum for Occupied Cells\n- Create a prefix sum matrix `s` where `s[i][j]` holds the number of occupied cells (1s) from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the cell (i, j).\n- Populate the prefix sum matrix by iterating over the grid and using the relationship:\n\\[ s[i][j] = s[i-1][j] + s[i][j-1] - s[i-1][j-1] + \\text{grid}[i-1][j-1] \\]\nThis helps in quickly determining how many occupied cells are in any sub-matrix.\n\n#### Part 2: Check and Place Stamps\n- Create a difference array `d` which will help in marking where stamps are placed.\n- Iterate over potential top-left corners where a stamp can be placed within the grid. For each potential position, check if the sub-matrix of size (stampHeight x stampWidth) from this top-left corner has any occupied cells:\n\\[ \\text{Number of occupied cells} = s[x][y] - s[x][j-1] - s[i-1][y] + s[i-1][j-1] \\]\n  where (x, y) is the bottom-right corner of the stamp's area.\n- If there are no occupied cells in the area, mark the difference array for this stamp placement to update this range:\n\\[ d[i][j] \\left.\\leftarrow +1 \\]\n\\[ d[i][y + 1] \\left.\\leftarrow -1 \\]\n\\[ d[x + 1][j] \\left.\\leftarrow -1 \\]\n\\[ d[x + 1][y + 1] \\left.\\leftarrow +1 \\]\n\n#### Part 3: Validate the Coverage\n- Use the difference array to determine how many times each cell is covered by stamps:\n  - Convert the difference array into actual coverage counts by applying cumulative sums:\n\\[ d[i][j] = d[i-1][j] + d[i][j-1] - d[i-1][j-1] + d[i][j] \\]\n- Finally, traverse the grid. For each empty cell (0), check if it is covered by at least one stamp using the difference array.\n  - If an empty cell is found uncovered, return `False`.\n  - If all empty cells are covered, return `True`.\n\n### Key Points\n- Ensure you understand the use of prefix sums and difference arrays as they are crucial for efficient range queries and updates.\n- Pay attention to array boundaries to avoid index errors.\n- Remember that stamps can overlap and use this to your advantage when placing them.\n\nBy following this approach, you will be able to determine if it is possible to cover all empty cells in the grid using the given constraints and requirements.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def possibleToStamp(\n        self, grid: List[List[int]], stampHeight: int, stampWidth: int\n    ) -> bool:\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        s = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n        for i, row in enumerate(grid, 1):\n            for j, v in enumerate(row, 1):\n                s[i][j] = s[i - 1][j] + s[i][j - 1] - s[i - 1][j - 1] + v\n        d = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]\n        for i in range(1, m - stampHeight + 2):\n            for j in range(1, n - stampWidth + 2):\n                x, y = i + stampHeight - 1, j + stampWidth - 1\n                if s[x][y] - s[x][j - 1] - s[i - 1][y] + s[i - 1][j - 1] == 0:\n                    d[i][j] += 1\n                    d[i][y + 1] -= 1\n                    d[x + 1][j] -= 1\n                    d[x + 1][y + 1] += 1\n        for i, row in enumerate(grid, 1):\n            for j, v in enumerate(row, 1):\n                d[i][j] += d[i - 1][j] + d[i][j - 1] - d[i - 1][j - 1]\n                if v == 0 and d[i][j] == 0:\n                    return False\n        return True\n", "problem_ids": ["stamping-the-grid"]}, "3032": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nWe are given n different types of stickers.

Your goal is to figure out the minimum number of these stickers you need to spell out a given target string by cutting out individual letters from the stickers and rearranging them. Each sticker can be used an infinite number of times.\n\n#### Step 2: Problem Constraints\n1. The number of stickers, \\( n \\), is between 1 and 50.\n2. Each sticker's word length is between 1 and 10 characters.\n3. The target string length is between 1 and 15 characters.\n4. All stickers and the target string consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n#### Step 3: Key Insight - State Representation\nGiven the small length of the target string (max 15 characters), we can represent the state of completion for the target string using a binary number:\n- A bit at position \\( i \\) in the binary number represents whether the \\( i \\)-th character of the target string has been spelled out.\n- If the bit is 1, it means the character at position \\( i \\) has been spelled out.\n- If the bit is 0, it means the character at position \\( i \\) has not been spelled out.\n\n#### Step 4: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS)\nWe'll approach the problem using BFS because it efficiently explores all possible ways to spell the target string to find the minimum number of steps:\n1. **Initial State**: Start with all bits as 0, meaning no characters of the target have been spelled out.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of states to be explored, starting from the initial state (0).\n3. **Visited States**: Use an array to mark visited states to avoid re-exploring them.\n\n#### Step 5: Mapping Stickers to Target Characters\nFor each state, try to use each sticker to spell out more characters of the target string:\n1. Convert the sticker into a frequency count of its characters.\n2. For each unspelled character in the target string, try to spell it using the current sticker.\n3. Update the state accordingly by setting the appropriate bits to 1.\n\n#### Step 6: Transition Between States\nFor every state in our BFS:\n1. Dequeue the current state.\n2. Check if this state corresponds to all bits being 1 (i.e., the target is spelled out completely). If so, return the number of steps (stickers used).\n3. For each sticker, calculate the new state by attempting to use its characters to spell more of the target string.\n4. If the new state hasn\u2019t been visited before, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n\n#### Step 7: Implement BFS Logic\n1. Initialize your queue with the starting state.\n2. Use a loop (while queue is not empty) to explore each state.\n3. For each state, iterate over all stickers to compute possible new states.\n4. Track the number of stickers used in the process.\n5. Return the minimum number of stickers when the target is spelled out (all bits set to 1), or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nThis high-level algorithm should help you understand how to approach the problem and implement a solution using BFS, state compression, and bit manipulation techniques. Remember, the BFS ensures that the first time you reach the final state where the target string can be completely spelled out, you have achieved it using the minimum number of stickers.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minStickers(self, stickers: List[str], target: str) -> int:\n        n = len(target)\n        q = deque([0])\n        vis = [False] * (1 << n)\n        vis[0] = True\n        ans = 0\n        while q:\n            for _ in range(len(q)):\n                cur = q.popleft()\n                if cur == (1 << n) - 1:\n                    return ans\n                for s in stickers:\n                    cnt = Counter(s)\n                    nxt = cur\n                    for i, c in enumerate(target):\n                        if (cur >> i & 1) == 0 and cnt[c] > 0:\n                            cnt[c] -= 1\n                            nxt |= 1 << i\n                    if not vis[nxt]:\n                        vis[nxt] = True\n                        q.append(nxt)\n            ans += 1\n        return -1\n", "problem_ids": ["stickers-to-spell-word"]}, "3033": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:\n\n'?'

The input string `s`, containing only lowercase English letters.\n2. The pattern `p`, which can contain lowercase English letters, '?' and '*'.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the pattern `p` matches the entire input string `s`. Here\u2019s how the special characters work in the pattern:\n- `?` matches any single character.\n- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).\n\nFor example:\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"a\"` should return `false` because \"a\" does not match \"aa\".\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"*\"` should return `true` because '*' can match any sequence, including \"aa\".\n- `s = \"cb\", p = \"?a\"` should return `false` because although '?' matches 'c', 'a' does not match 'b'.\n\n#### Approach to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem effectively, you can use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - Design a function `dfs(i, j)` that will check if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` matches the substring of `p` starting from index `j`.\n   - The result would be stored in a cache to avoid recomputation.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `i` (the current position in `s`) is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, the function should return `True` only if `j` (the current position in `p`) is also at or beyond the end of `p`, or if the remaining characters in `p` are all '*'.\n   - If `j` is beyond the length of `p` but `i` isn't, return `False` since pattern `p` lacks more characters to match with `s`.\n\n3. **Handling '*' Character**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '*', check the following possibilities:\n     - The '*' matches zero characters \u2013 move to the next character in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i, j + 1)`).\n     - The '*' matches one or more characters \u2013 move to the next character in `s` but keep the current position in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j)`) or move to the next character in both `s` and `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n4. **Handling '?' Character or Exact Match**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '?' or the characters in `s` and `p` match, then move to the next characters in both the strings (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n5. **Memoization**:\n   - Use a caching mechanism to store the results of function calls to avoid redundant calculations. This will help in improving the efficiency drastically.\n\n6. **Final Check**:\n   - Begin the recursion from the start of both the strings (i.e., call `dfs(0, 0)`).\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\nYou can summarize the above logic into the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction isMatch(s, p):\n    memo = createEmptyCache()  # Initialize a cache to store results\n\n    Define function dfs(i, j):\n        if i >= length(s):\n            return j >= length(p) OR (p[j] == '*' AND func(i, j + 1))\n        if j >= length(p):\n            return False\n        if p[j] == '*':\n            return dfs(i + 1, j) OR dfs(i + 1, j + 1) OR dfs(i, j + 1)\n        return (p[j] == '?' OR s[i] == p[j]) AND dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n    return dfs(0, 0)\n\nCall isMatch with the strings s and p.\n```\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to construct a solution for the wildcard pattern matching problem by carefully defining and implementing the recursive function `dfs` with memoization. This will ensure you handle all possible pattern matching scenarios efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> bool:\n            if i >= len(s):\n                return j >= len(p) or (p[j] == \"*\" and dfs(i, j + 1))\n            if j >= len(p):\n                return False\n            if p[j] == \"*\":\n                return dfs(i + 1, j) or dfs(i + 1, j + 1) or dfs(i, j + 1)\n            return (p[j] == \"?\" or s[i] == p[j]) and dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n        return dfs(0, 0)\n", "problem_ids": ["wildcard-matching"]}, "3034": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two 0-indexed binary arrays nums1 and nums2.

Calculate a new array where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of nums1 and nums2.\n2. The task then becomes finding the longest subarray in this new array with a sum of zero.\n\n### Approach and Plan\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Transform the Problem**:\n    - Create a new array \"differences\" where each element is the difference between nums1 and nums2 at each index. This means for each index \\(i\\):\n    \\[ differences[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i] \\]\n\n2. **Use Prefix Sums and Hash Table**:\n    - Define a prefix sum \\(s\\) which will help in calculating the cumulative sum up to any index. Initialize this to zero.\n    - Use a hash table (dictionary) to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum. Initialize this with the entry (0, -1) to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning has a sum of zero.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compute**:\n    - Traverse through each element of the \"differences\" array, calculating the prefix sum at each step.\n    - For each prefix sum, check if it has been seen before in the hash table:\n        - If yes, it means there is a subarray (from the first occurrence + 1 to the current index) with a sum of zero. Update the answer if the current subarray is the widest so far.\n        - If no, store the current prefix sum with its index in the hash table for the first time.\n    - Continue this process until you've examined all elements.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n    - The answer stored will be the distance of the widest (i, j) pair found.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n    - Declare a dictionary `d` to store prefix sums and their first occurrences. Initialize it with `{0: -1}`.\n    - Initialize variables `ans` (to track the widest distance) and `s` (for the running prefix sum) to 0.\n\n2. **Traverse the Arrays**:\n    - For each index \\(i\\), compute the difference between elements of nums1 and nums2, and add this to the running prefix sum \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Update the Hash Table**:\n    - Check if this prefix sum \\(s\\) is already in the dictionary `d`:\n        - If it is, calculate the distance using \\(i - d[s]\\) and update `ans` if this distance is larger than the current maximum.\n        - If it is not in the dictionary, store \\(s\\) with the current index \\(i\\).\n\n4. **Completion**:\n    - After the entire array has been processed, the value of `ans` will be the result.\n\nBy following these steps, the algorithm efficiently finds the widest pair of indices with equal sums in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity and \\(O(n)\\) space complexity due to the use of prefix sums and a hash table for quick lookups.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def widestPairOfIndices(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:\n        d = {0: -1}\n        ans = s = 0\n        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(nums1, nums2)):\n            s += a - b\n            if s in d:\n                ans = max(ans, i - d[s])\n            else:\n                d[s] = i\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["widest-pair-of-indices-with-equal-range-sum"]}, "3044": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven three integer arrays nums1, nums2, and nums3, return a distinct array containing all the values that are present in at least two out of the three arrays.

Your task is to create a new array containing all unique values that appear in at least two of these three arrays. You can return the array in any order.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Inputs and Outputs:**\n   - You have three arrays of integers: `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`.\n   - Each array can contain numbers between 1 and 100.\n   - Your goal is to return an array of numbers that appear in at least two of these arrays. \n\n2. **Convert Arrays to Sets:**\n   - Convert each of the three arrays to sets. This helps in quickly checking the presence of elements and automatically removes any duplicate values within each array.\n\n3. **Enumerate Possible Values:**\n   - Since the array values are bounded between 1 and 100, you can iterate through this range and check if a number is present in at least two of the sets.\n\n4. **Check for Common Values:**\n   - For each number from 1 to 100, check if it appears in at least two of the three sets. \n   - If a number satisfies this condition, add it to your result list.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - Once you've iterated through the possible values and collected all the numbers that appear in at least two arrays, return this list as your result.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Convert to Sets:**\n   - Convert `nums1` to a set called `s1`.\n   - Convert `nums2` to a set called `s2`.\n   - Convert `nums3` to a set called `s3`.\n\n2. **Initialize Result List:**\n   - Create an empty list, say `result`, to store the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n3. **Enumerate and Check:**\n   - Iterate through each number `i` from 1 to 100:\n     - Check if `i` is in `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`.\n     - Use logical conditions to count how many of the sets contain `i`.\n     - If `i` is found in at least two of these sets, add `i` to `result`.\n\n4. **Return the Result List:**\n   - After completing the iteration, return the `result` list.\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3` to sets:\n   ```\n   s1 = set(nums1)\n   s2 = set(nums2)\n   s3 = set(nums3)\n   ```\n2. Initialize the result list:\n   ```\n   result = []\n   ```\n3. Iterate through numbers 1 to 100:\n   ```\n   for i in range(1, 101):\n       count = 0\n       if i in s1:\n           count += 1\n       if i in s2:\n           count += 1\n       if i in s3:\n           count += 1\n       \n       if count >= 2:\n           result.append(i)\n   ```\n4. Return the result list:\n   ```\n   return result\n   ```\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Sets**: Using sets helps in efficiently managing and checking for the presence of elements.\n- **Iteration**: Iterating from 1 to 100 ensures you cover all possible values within the given constraints.\n- **Condition Checking**: Counting the presence of each number in the three sets allows you to determine if a number should be included in the result.\n\nFollowing these steps systematically will help you solve the problem efficiently.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "3046": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nAlice and Bob each have a lexicographically sorted array of strings named a and b respectively.\nThey are playing a wording game with the following rules:\n\nOn each turn, the current player should play a word from their list such that the new word is closely greater than the last played word; then it's the other player's turn.\nIf a player can't play a word on their turn, they lose.\n\nAlice starts the game by playing her lexicographically smallest word.\nGiven a and b, return true if Alice can win knowing that both players play their best, and false otherwise.\nA word w is closely greater than a word z if the following conditions are met:\n\nw is lexicographically greater than z.\nIf w1 is the first letter of w and z1 is the first letter of z, w1 should either be equal to z1 or be the letter after z1 in the alphabet.\nFor example, the word \"care\" is closely greater than \"book\" and \"car\", but is not closely greater than \"ant\" or \"cook\".\n\nA string s is lexicographically greater than a string t if in the first position where s and t differ, string s has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in t.

The game has specific rules for choosing words from these arrays. Alice starts the game by playing the smallest word in her list. \n\nThe key points to remember:\n- A word that is played must be \"closely greater\" than the previous word, meaning it is lexicographically greater and adheres to specific conditions.\n- If a player can't make a move, they lose.\n\nThe objective is to determine whether Alice can ensure her victory if both players play optimally.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n    - Alice plays the smallest word from her array `a`, so start by picking `a[0]`.\n2. **Turn Indication**:\n    - Use a variable `k` where `k = 0` means it's Alice's turn, and `k = 1` means it's Bob's turn.\n3. **Indices Tracking**:\n    - Use two indices `i` and `j` to track the current word being considered by Alice and Bob respectively (`i` for Alice, `j` for Bob).\n4. **Condition for Next Word**:\n    - The next word must be lexicographically greater and either:\n        - Have the same first letter, or\n        - Have a first letter that is the subsequent letter of the alphabet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n    - Start by setting `i = 1` since Alice has already played `a[0]`.\n    - Initialize `j = 0` for Bob and `w = a[0]` as the currently played word.\n    - Set `k = 1` initially to indicate it's Bob's turn next.\n\n2. **Game Loop**:\n    - While the game continues, you will check whose turn it is and evaluate the possible moves.\n    \n    - **If it's Bob's turn (`k = 1`)**:\n        - Check if Bob has no more words to play (`j == len(b)`). If true, Alice wins, return `True`.\n        - Otherwise, see if the current word `b[j]` can be played. It must satisfy:\n            - Either `b[j]` has the same first letter as `w` and is greater than `w`.\n            - Or `b[j]` starts with a letter immediately following the first letter of `w`.\n        - If `b[j]` can be played, set `w = b[j]` and switch the turn (`k ^= 1`).\n        - If Bob can\u2019t play `b[j]`, increment `j` to check the next word in his list.\n\n    - **If it's Alice's turn (`k = 0`)**:\n        - Check if Alice has no more words to play (`i == len(a)`). If true, Bob wins, return `False`.\n        - Otherwise, see if the current word `a[i]` can be played. It must satisfy:\n            - Either `a[i]` has the same first letter as `w` and is greater than `w`.\n            - Or `a[i]` starts with a letter immediately following the first letter of `w`.\n        - If `a[i]` can be played, set `w = a[i]` and switch the turn (`k ^= 1`).\n        - If Alice can\u2019t play `a[i]`, increment `i` to check the next word in her list.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Lexicographical Order**: Understand the order in which words follow one another in a dictionary.\n- **Game Termination**: Carefully consider the game ending conditions for both players.\n- **Efficient Traversal**: Minimize the number of checks by making sure you only traverse each player's word list as necessary.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nConsider the example where `a = [\"ananas\", \"atlas\", \"banana\"]` and `b = [\"albatros\", \"cikla\", \"nogomet\"]`.\n1.

Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "3055": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nAlice and Bob each have a lexicographically sorted array of strings named a and b respectively.\nThey are playing a wording game with the following rules:\n\nOn each turn, the current player should play a word from their list such that the new word is closely greater than the last played word; then it's the other player's turn.\nIf a player can't play a word on their turn, they lose.\n\nAlice starts the game by playing her lexicographically smallest word.\nGiven a and b, return true if Alice can win knowing that both players play their best, and false otherwise.\nA word w is closely greater than a word z if the following conditions are met:\n\nw is lexicographically greater than z.\nIf w1 is the first letter of w and z1 is the first letter of z, w1 should either be equal to z1 or be the letter after z1 in the alphabet.\nFor example, the word \"care\" is closely greater than \"book\" and \"car\", but is not closely greater than \"ant\" or \"cook\".\n\nA string s is lexicographically greater than a string t if in the first position where s and t differ, string s has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in t.

The game has specific rules for choosing words from these arrays. Alice starts the game by playing the smallest word in her list. \n\nThe key points to remember:\n- A word that is played must be \"closely greater\" than the previous word, meaning it is lexicographically greater and adheres to specific conditions.\n- If a player can't make a move, they lose.\n\nThe objective is to determine whether Alice can ensure her victory if both players play optimally.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n    - Alice plays the smallest word from her array `a`, so start by picking `a[0]`.\n2. **Turn Indication**:\n    - Use a variable `k` where `k = 0` means it's Alice's turn, and `k = 1` means it's Bob's turn.\n3. **Indices Tracking**:\n    - Use two indices `i` and `j` to track the current word being considered by Alice and Bob respectively (`i` for Alice, `j` for Bob).\n4. **Condition for Next Word**:\n    - The next word must be lexicographically greater and either:\n        - Have the same first letter, or\n        - Have a first letter that is the subsequent letter of the alphabet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n    - Start by setting `i = 1` since Alice has already played `a[0]`.\n    - Initialize `j = 0` for Bob and `w = a[0]` as the currently played word.\n    - Set `k = 1` initially to indicate it's Bob's turn next.\n\n2. **Game Loop**:\n    - While the game continues, you will check whose turn it is and evaluate the possible moves.\n    \n    - **If it's Bob's turn (`k = 1`)**:\n        - Check if Bob has no more words to play (`j == len(b)`). If true, Alice wins, return `True`.\n        - Otherwise, see if the current word `b[j]` can be played. It must satisfy:\n            - Either `b[j]` has the same first letter as `w` and is greater than `w`.\n            - Or `b[j]` starts with a letter immediately following the first letter of `w`.\n        - If `b[j]` can be played, set `w = b[j]` and switch the turn (`k ^= 1`).\n        - If Bob can\u2019t play `b[j]`, increment `j` to check the next word in his list.\n\n    - **If it's Alice's turn (`k = 0`)**:\n        - Check if Alice has no more words to play (`i == len(a)`). If true, Bob wins, return `False`.\n        - Otherwise, see if the current word `a[i]` can be played. It must satisfy:\n            - Either `a[i]` has the same first letter as `w` and is greater than `w`.\n            - Or `a[i]` starts with a letter immediately following the first letter of `w`.\n        - If `a[i]` can be played, set `w = a[i]` and switch the turn (`k ^= 1`).\n        - If Alice can\u2019t play `a[i]`, increment `i` to check the next word in her list.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Lexicographical Order**: Understand the order in which words follow one another in a dictionary.\n- **Game Termination**: Carefully consider the game ending conditions for both players.\n- **Efficient Traversal**: Minimize the number of checks by making sure you only traverse each player's word list as necessary.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nConsider the example where `a = [\"ananas\", \"atlas\", \"banana\"]` and `b = [\"albatros\", \"cikla\", \"nogomet\"]`.\n1. Alice starts by playing `\"ananas\"`.\n2. Bob checks `b[0]=\"albatros\"`, but it\u2019s not greater than `\"ananas\"`.\n3. Bob has no valid words to play next, so Alice wins.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy maintaining and updating indices and the current word conditionally based on the rules of the game, you can effectively simulate the back-and-forth turns of the game.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed such that some subsequence of `nums` sums up to the target value. If it is impossible to achieve this, you should return `-1`. \n\nAn operation consists of picking an element in the array that is greater than 1, removing it, and adding two occurrences of half its value back into the array.\n\n## Observations\n\n1. **Sum and Target Relationship**: First, if the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than the target, it's impossible to reach the target, so you should return `-1` immediately.\n2. **Binary Representation**: Each number in `nums` and the `target` can be represented in binary form. If you break down the problem into bits, it becomes easier to manage.\n\n## Approach\n\n### Step 1: Initial Sum Check\n\n1. Calculate the sum of all elements in `nums`.\n2. If this sum is less than the target, return `-1`.\n\n### Step 2: Track Powers of 2 in `nums`\n\n1. Use an array `cnt` of length 32 (since we are working with 32-bit integers) to keep count of each power of 2 present in `nums`.\n2. For every number in `nums`, convert it to binary format and update the corresponding index in the `cnt` array. For example, if the number is 8 (which is \\(2^3\\)), increment the count of index 3 in `cnt`.\n\n### Step 3: Work with Bits of Target\n\n1. Start checking from the least significant bit (LSB) of the target.\n2. For each bit in the target:\n    - If the bit is `0`, move to the next bit.\n    - If the bit is `1`, find the smallest higher bit with a count greater than `0` in `cnt`.\n3. Split the number corresponding to this higher bit down to the current bit.\n\n### Splitting Mechanism\n\n1. If splitting a number: Adjust counts in the `cnt` array such that the higher bit has `0` elements and distribute its value to lower bits.\n2. Track the number of operations needed to achieve this split.\n\n### Combining Bits\n\n1. If a bit cannot directly satisfy the requirement, combine bits to form higher bits until you can fulfill the requirement of the current target bit.\n\n### Final Counting and Return\n\n1. Continue this process until you have processed all bits of the target.\n2. Return the total count of operations performed.\n\n## Summary\n1. **Initial Sum Check**: Validate if the total sum of `nums` is sufficient.\n2. **Bit Tracking**: Track the presence of each power of 2 in `nums`.\n3. **Bitwise Processing**: For each bit in the target, ensure that you attempt to satisfy it by splitting/combining values as needed.\n4. **Counting Operations**: Track your operations and return the count once done; otherwise, return `-1` if impossible.\n\nThis approach ensures that you are greedily working with the smallest possible splits and efficiently using your resources to meet the target. By leveraging bit manipulation and counting techniques, you can systematically resolve the problem.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to solve the problem systematically without getting overwhelmed by the operation constraints.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        s = sum(nums)\n        if s < target:\n            return -1\n        cnt = [0] * 32\n        for x in nums:\n            for i in range(32):\n                if x >> i & 1:\n                    cnt[i] += 1\n        i = j = 0\n        ans = 0\n        while 1:\n            while i < 32 and (target >> i & 1) == 0:\n                i += 1\n            if i == 32:\n                break\n            while j < i:\n                cnt[j + 1] += cnt[j] // 2\n                cnt[j] %= 2\n                j += 1\n            while cnt[j] == 0:\n                cnt[j] = 1\n                j += 1\n            ans += j - i\n            cnt[j] -= 1\n            j = i\n            i += 1\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-operations-to-form-subsequence-with-target-sum"]}, "3081": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA magician has various spells.\nYou are given an array power, where each element represents the damage of a spell.

Let's break down the process of solving this problem into clear steps. Imagine you are guiding a student step-by-step through the solution. Here's how you could approach it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Maximum Possible Total Damage Problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:\n    - You're given an array where each element represents the damage of a spell.\n    - If you cast a spell with damage `power[i]`, you can't cast any spells with damages `power[i] - 2`, `power[i] - 1`, `power[i] + 1`, or `power[i] + 2`.\n    - Your task is to find the maximum possible total damage by selecting an optimal subset of spells.\n\n2. **Initial Considerations**:\n    - Notice the problem constraint and the challenge involved in ensuring no two selected spells are in conflict in terms of their damage values.\n    - Plan to use a combination of sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming with memoization to achieve an efficient solution.\n\n3. **Sorting and Counting**:\n    - **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. Sorting helps you manage the selection process efficiently.\n    - **Count Occurrences**: Use a hash table (like Python\u2019s Counter) to count the occurrences of each damage value. This helps in efficiently managing multiples of the same damage.\n\n4. **Determine Next Valid Index**:\n    - For each damage value, you need to determine the first index in the sorted array that holds a value greater than the current damage plus 2 (`power[i] + 2`). This helps in avoiding invalid selections. Use binary search to find this index efficiently.\n    - Store these indices in an array, which we'll call `nxt`.\n\n5. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:\n    - Define a function (`dfs`) that calculates the maximum damage starting from the `i`-th index.\n    - In the `dfs` function, you have two choices:\n        1. **Skip Current Damage**: Skip all occurrences of the current damage and move to the next index that follows these occurrences.\n        2. **Use Current Damage**: Use all occurrences of the current damage and move to the next valid index found using the `nxt` array.\n    - Recursively compute the maximum possible damage for both choices and take the higher of the two.\n\n6. **Memoization**:\n    - To avoid recalculating the results for the same indices multiple times, store the results in a memoization table. Typically, you can use a list where each index stores the result of `dfs` starting from that index.\n\n7. **Calculate Maximum Damage**:\n    - Start the `dfs` function from the first index (0) and use it to calculate the maximum possible total damage.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\nConsider the `power` array `[1, 1, 3, 4]`:\n1. **Sort and Count**:\n    - Sorted array: `[1, 1, 3, 4]`\n    - Count occurrences: `{1: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`\n2. **Next Valid Index**:\n    - For `1`: Next value greater than `1+2` (3) is 3 (index 2)\n    - For `3`: Next value greater than `3+2` (5) is beyond the array (index 4)\n    - For `4`: Next value greater than `4+2` (6) is beyond the array (index 4)\n3. **DFS Approach**:\n    - Start from index 0.\n    - Either skip the value `1` and start from index 2 (`3`), or use all `1`s (total 2 damage) and move to index 2.\n    - Similarly make decisions at subsequent steps and compute the maximum damage.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you will efficiently solve the problem while handling all constraints and maximizing the total damage output.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maximumTotalDamage(self, power: List[int]) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int) -> int:\n            if i >= n:\n                return 0\n            a = dfs(i + cnt[power[i]])\n            b = power[i] * cnt[power[i]] + dfs(nxt[i])\n            return max(a, b)\n\n        n = len(power)\n        cnt = Counter(power)\n        power.sort()\n        nxt = [bisect_right(power, x + 2, lo=i + 1) for i, x in enumerate(power)]\n        return dfs(0)\n", "problem_ids": ["maximum-total-damage-with-spell-casting"]}, "3091": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k.\nA subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k.\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array nums.\nA subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2. Initiate the counter and subset count.\n3. Call the `dfs(0)` to start from the first element.\n4. Return the final count of beautiful subsets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution to find all beautiful subsets of the given array.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "3094": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output:**\n   - You are given an integer array `tasks`, where each element represents the difficulty level of a task.\n   - Your goal is to determine the minimum number of rounds required to complete all the tasks. In each round, you can only complete 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.\n   - If it's not possible to complete all the tasks under the given rules, you should return `-1`.\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   - If there is any difficulty level with exactly 1 task, it's impossible to complete that task within the given rules. In such cases, the answer should be `-1` immediately.\n\n3. **Counting Tasks:**\n   - Start by counting the number of tasks for each difficulty level. This can be done using a hash table (or dictionary), where the key is the difficulty level and the value is the count of tasks of that difficulty.\n\n4. **Calculating Rounds for Each Difficulty:**\n   - For each difficulty level, check the count of tasks.\n   - If the count is 1, return `-1` because you cannot complete a single task by itself under the rules.\n   - If the count is greater than 1, calculate the minimum number of rounds required to complete the tasks. You can do this using a combination of groups of 2 and 3 tasks:\n     - Ideally, try to maximize the use of groups of 3 tasks.\n     - If there are no remaining tasks (i.e., the count is divisible by 3), then the number of rounds can be calculated directly.\n     - If there are 1 or 2 remaining tasks after forming groups of 3, you will need an additional round (either a group of 2 or both a group of 2 and 3) to complete those tasks.\n\n5. **Summing Up the Rounds:**\n   - Accumulate the rounds needed for each difficulty level to get the total minimum number of rounds needed to complete all tasks.\n\n6. **Returning the Result:**\n   - Finally, return the total number of rounds. If at any point it was found that a difficulty level has only one task, return `-1`.\n\n### Detailed Steps to Implement the Solution:\n\n1. **Count the Tasks:**\n   - Traverse the `tasks` array and use a hash table to record the number of tasks for each difficulty level.\n   \n2. **Iterate Through the Hash Table:**\n   - For each entry (difficulty level) in the hash table:\n     - Check if the count is 1. If so, return `-1`.\n     - Otherwise, determine the number of rounds:\n       - Calculate how many full rounds of 3 tasks can be performed.\n       - Check if there are remaining tasks. If there are 1 or 2 tasks left, add one more round to account for them.\n\n3. **Aggregate the Results:**\n   - Accumulate the total number of rounds needed for all difficulty levels.\n   - Return the accumulated number of rounds as the final result.\n\nBy following these steps methodically, you can solve the problem efficiently. Remember, handling edge cases (like a single task of any difficulty) early on in your solution can save you from complex later stages of verification.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumRounds(self, tasks: List[int]) -> int:\n        cnt = Counter(tasks)\n        ans = 0\n        for v in cnt.values():\n            if v == 1:\n                return -1\n            ans += v // 3 + (v % 3 != 0)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-rounds-to-complete-all-tasks"]}, "3104": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array of positive integers beans, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.\nRemove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal.

You need to remove some beans from each of the bags in such a way that the remaining beans in each non-empty bag are equal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of beans you need to remove to achieve this.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Initial Thought Process**:\n   - For any given number of beans, there will be two types of operations: keeping all beans in a bag or removing enough beans so that each remaining bag has the same number of beans.\n   - We need to figure out a strategy to minimize the number of removals.\n\n2. **Sorting the Array**:\n   - First, sort the array of bean counts in ascending order. This will help you set a baseline for comparing bean counts in a systematic way.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Beans**:\n   - Compute the total number of beans across all bags. This will be used to determine how many beans need to be removed.\n\n4. **Enumerate Each Bag's Beans as the Target**:\n   - Iterate over each unique bean count in the sorted array and consider this as the possible target number of beans for the remaining non-empty bags.\n   - For each bean count in the enumeration, all bags with more beans than this count will need beans removed to match this count.\n\n5. **Remaining Beans Calculation**:\n   - For each target count, calculate the total number of remaining beans if every bag with more beans than this target count is reduced to this number.\n   - The formula to calculate remaining beans is: `target_count \u00d7 number_of_bags_with_at_least_target_beans`\n   - To determine how many beans need to be removed for this target, subtract the remaining beans from the total number of beans.\n\n6. **Find the Minimum Removal**:\n   - Track the minimum number of beans that need to be removed across all possible target counts.\n\n#### Detailed Algorithm\n\n1. **Sort the Array**:\n   - Start by sorting the array of beans in ascending order.\n   - Example: If your input is `[4, 1, 6, 5]`, after sorting, it will be `[1, 4, 5, 6]`.\n\n2. **Compute Total Beans**:\n   - Calculate the sum of beans in the array.\n   - Example: `1 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 16`\n\n3. **Iterate and Calculate Removal for Each Target**:\n   - Loop through the sorted array and for each bean count at index `i`:\n     - Calculate the number of beans that would remain if all bags with more beans than the current bean count are reduced to that count.\n     - The number of remaining beans for target `beans[i]` is given by `beans[i] * (total_bags - i)`, where `total_bags` is the total number of bags.\n     - Calculate beans to remove: `total_beans - remaining_beans`\n\n4. **Track Minimum Beans to Remove**:\n   - Keep a running track of the minimum number of beans removed over all iterations.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nGiven `beans = [4, 1, 6, 5]`:\n\n1. **Sort the array**: `[1, 4, 5, 6]`\n2. **Total beans**: `16`\n\nIterate over each element:\n- For target `1` (index `0`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `1` bean: `1 * (4 - 0) = 4`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 4 = 12`\n- For target `4` (index `1`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `4` beans: `4 * (4 - 1) = 12`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 12 = 4`\n- For target `5` (index `2`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `5` beans: `5 * (4 - 2) = 10`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 10 = 6`\n- For target `6` (index `3`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `6` beans: `6 * (4 - 3) = 6`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 6 = 10`\n\nThe minimum beans removed are `4` for target `4`.\n\nBy following this detailed approach, you will be able to systematically determine the minimum number of beans to remove, ensuring all non-empty bags have the same number of beans.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumRemoval(self, beans: List[int]) -> int:\n        beans.sort()\n        s, n = sum(beans), len(beans)\n        return min(s - x * (n - i) for i, x in enumerate(beans))\n", "problem_ids": ["removing-minimum-number-of-magic-beans"]}, "3106": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative.

A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the original sequence, but the remaining elements should stay in their original order.\n\n**Examples for Clarity:**\n- Example 1: For [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5], the output is 6 because the entire sequence is already a wiggle sequence.\n- Example 2: For [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8], the output is 7 for subsequence [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8].\n- Example 3: For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the output is 2 for subsequence [1, 9].\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem Using Dynamic Programming:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define two arrays `up` and `down`. \n   - `up[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with an upward trend.\n   - `down[i]` will represent the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` with a downward trend.\n   - Initialize both arrays with `1` because any single element sequence has a wiggle length of `1`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last.\n   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with all preceding elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend a downward trend sequence ending at `j` to an upward trend at `i`. Update `up[i]` as the maximum of `up[i]` and `down[j] + 1`.\n       - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than a preceding element `nums[j]`, it means you can extend an upward trend sequence ending at `j` to a downward trend at `i`. Update `down[i]` as the maximum of `down[i]` and `up[j] + 1`.\n   - Update an overall maximum length `ans` by comparing `up[i]` and `down[i]` after each iteration.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The longest wiggle subsequence length will be the maximum value in the last `ans`, which you maintain throughout the iteration.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to nested loops (iterating each element and comparing it with all preceding elements).\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 7, 4]`:\n\n- Initialize `up = [1, 1, 1]` and `down = [1, 1, 1]`.\n- For `i = 1`, compare `nums[1] (7)` with `nums[0] (1)`:\n  - `7 > 1`, so `up[1] = max(up[1], down[0] + 1)` which results in `up[1] = 2`. Update `ans` to 2 since it's the maximum between `up[1]` and `down[1]`.\n- For `i = 2`, compare `nums[2] (4)` with `nums[0] (1)` and `nums[1] (7)`:\n  - `4 > 1`, so nothing changes because `up[2]` remains 1.\n  - `4 < 7`, so `down[2] = max(down[2], up[1] + 1)` which results in `down[2] = 3`. Update `ans` to 3 (now maximum between `up[2]` and `down[2]`).\n\n- The final length is `max(up[2], down[2])`, which is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop a solution to find the longest wiggle subsequence effectively.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you understand and solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n    - You have a list of heights which represent the elevation map where each index corresponds to the height of the bar at that position.\n    - Your task is to determine how much rainwater can be trapped between these bars after raining.\n\n2. **Conceptualize the Solution**:\n    - To solve this problem, you need to know how much water can be trapped above each bar.\n    - For each bar at position `i`, the amount of water trapped above it is determined by the shortest bar on its left and right minus the height at position `i`.\n\n3. **Define Necessary Variables**:\n    - Two arrays: `left` and `right` will be needed\u2014`left[i]` indicating the maximum height to the left of and including the bar at index `i`, and `right[i]` indicating the maximum height to the right of and including the bar at index `i`.\n\n4. **Determine `left` Array**:\n    - Initialize `left[0]` to be the height of the first bar since there's nothing to its left.\n    - For each subsequent bar, the value at `left[i]` will be the maximum of the height at `i` or `left[i-1]`. This ensures that you\u2019re always considering the tallest bar from the left up to index `i`.\n\n5. **Determine `right` Array**:\n    - Initialize `right[n-1]` to be the height of the last bar since there's nothing to its right.\n    - For each previous bar, the value at `right[i]` will be the maximum of the height at `i` or `right[i+1]`. This ensures that you\u2019re always considering the tallest bar from the right up to index `i`.\n\n6. **Calculate Trapped Water**:\n    - For each bar at index `i`, the water that can be trapped is calculated as the minimum of `left[i]` and `right[i]` minus the height of the bar at that position.\n    - Sum up these values for all bars to get the total amount of trapped rainwater.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Arrays**:\n    - Create two arrays `left` and `right` of the same length as the input list `height`.\n\n2. **Fill the Left Array**:\n    - Set `left[0]` to `height[0]`.\n    - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, update `left[i]` as: \n      ```python\n      left[i] = max(left[i - 1], height[i])\n      ```\n\n3. **Fill the Right Array**:\n    - Set `right[n-1]` to `height[n-1]`.\n    - For each index `i` from `n-2` to 0, update `right[i]` as:\n      ```python\n      right[i] = max(right[i + 1], height[i])\n      ```\n\n4. **Compute Total Water Trapped**:\n    - Initialize a variable `trapped_water` to 0.\n    - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, add to `trapped_water`:\n      ```python\n      trapped_water += min(left[i], right[i]) - height[i]\n      ```\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n    - The variable `trapped_water` now contains the total amount of water trapped.\n\n#### Example\n\nFor the list `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`:\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - `left` array becomes `[0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]`\n  - `right` array becomes `[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1]`\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Calculate water trapped at each index:\n    - For index 1, `min(1,3) - 1 = 0`\n    - For index 2, `min(1,3) - 0 = 1`\n    - and so on...\n  - Sum the trapped water for all indices to get the result: `6`.\n\nBy following this guide, you will be able to compute the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the bars after raining for any given list of heights.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(height)\n        left = [height[0]] * n\n        right = [height[-1]] * n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            left[i] = max(left[i - 1], height[i])\n            right[n - i - 1] = max(right[n - i], height[n - i - 1])\n        return sum(min(l, r) - h for l, r, h in zip(left, right, height))\n", "problem_ids": ["trapping-rain-water"]}, "3141": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array nums and an integer x.

You can remove elements from either the beginning or the end of the array and subtract their values from \\( x \\). You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce \\( x \\) to exactly zero. If it is not possible, return \\(-1\\).\n\n### Approach to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we use a combination of prefix sums and a hash table to track the longest subarray with a certain sum. Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. **Transform the Problem:** Instead of directly removing elements from both ends and trying to reduce \\( x \\), think of the problem as finding a subarray in \\( nums \\) where the sum of the subarray is equal to the total sum of \\( nums \\) minus \\( x \\). This way, reducing \\( x \\) to zero can be rephrased as removing all elements that are not part of this subarray.\n\n2. **Calculate the Target Sum:** Compute the target sum \\( s \\) that the subarray needs to achieve. This sum is the total sum of the array minus \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\text{sum}(nums) - x\n   \\]\n   If \\( s \\) is negative, it's not possible to reduce \\( x \\) to zero, and you should return \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Setup a Hash Table:** Utilize a hash table to record the prefix sums. The prefix sum up to index \\( i \\) is the sum of all elements from the start of the array to \\( i \\). Initially, set a prefix sum of zero at index \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{vis} = \\{0: -1\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Traverse the Array:** Iterate through the array while computing the current prefix sum. For each element in \\( nums \\):\n   - Add the element to the current prefix sum.\n   - Check if the prefix sum needed to achieve the target sum exists in the hash table.\n   - If it exists, update the length of the longest subarray.\n   - Add the current prefix sum and its index to the hash table if it does not exist.\n\n5. **Update the Maximum Length:** Keep track of the maximum length of the subarray with the sum \\( s \\). Update it whenever you find a valid subarray sum.\n\n6. **Determine the Result:** After processing the entire array, if you haven't found any valid subarray, return \\(-1\\). Otherwise, the minimum number of operations to reduce \\( x \\) to zero would be the total length of the array minus the length of this subarray.\n\n### Step-by-Step Example:\n\nLet's work through an example to make things clearer:\n   - **Example 1:**\n     - Input: `nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3], x = 5`\n     - Compute `s = sum(nums) - x = 11 - 5 = 6`\n     - Traverse the array while maintaining the prefix sum and update the hash table.\n       - Prefix sums: `1, 2, 6, 8, 11`\n       - Hash table updates: `{0: -1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 6: 2, 8: 3, 11: 4}`\n       - Check for prefix sums needed to achieve `s`: \n         - When prefix sum (6) is achieved at index 2, the subarray `[1, 1, 4]` sums to 6.\n     - `mx` gets updated to 3, resulting in `len(nums) - mx = 5 - 3 = 2`.\n     - Output: 2\n\n### Conclusion\nBy transforming the problem into finding a subarray with a specific sum, you reduce the complexity and make it possible to solve it more efficiently using a hash table and prefix sums. This approach ensures that you are computing the result in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs.\n\nBy following these steps methodically, you should be able to solve the problem without directly writing the solution code initially. Understanding the logic and breaking down the problem helps in eventually implementing the solution.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        s = sum(nums) - x\n        vis = {0: -1}\n        mx, t = -1, 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(nums):\n            t += v\n            if t not in vis:\n                vis[t] = i\n            if t - s in vis:\n                mx = max(mx, i - vis[t - s])\n        return -1 if mx == -1 else len(nums) - mx\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero"]}, "3150": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and a non-negative integer k.

Here\u2019s a detailed guide to help you solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', and a non-negative integer `k`. You need to determine the minimum number of minutes required to take at least `k` of each character ('a', 'b', and 'c') from either the leftmost or the rightmost end of the string. If it's not possible to take `k` of each character, you should return `-1`.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - Input: s = \"aabaaaacaabc\", k = 2\n   - You can approach from both ends of the string to take characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n   - One possible way: \n     - Take three characters from the left (\"aab\"). You have two 'a' characters and one 'b'.\n     - Take five characters from the right (\"caabc\"). You get additional two 'a', one 'b', and two 'c'.\n     - Total time: 3 + 5 = 8 minutes\n   - Output: 8\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - Input: s = \"a\", k = 1\n   - Not possible to have at least one 'b' or 'c'.\n   - Output: -1\n\n### Plan and Approach\n\n1. **Initial Check**: \n   - First, count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string `s`. If any of these characters appear less than `k` times, you can directly return `-1` because it's impossible to collect `k` of each character.\n\n2. **Reverse Problem**:\n   - Think of the problem in reverse: instead of trying to keep characters from both ends, think about removing a substring in the middle. The characters remaining on the sides should still have at least `k` of each 'a', 'b', and 'c'. \n\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - Maintain a sliding window to represent the substring you are \"removing\" from the middle.\n   - Use two pointers, `j` (left boundary) and `i` (right boundary) of the window, initialized to 0.\n   - As you expand the window by moving `i`, decrement the count of the character `s[i]` from the total count.\n\n4. **Window Adjustment**:\n   - If the count of the character being decremented (due to expanding the window) drops below `k`, increment `j` to shrink the window from the left until all characters outside the window have at least `k` count.\n\n5. **Track Maximum Window Size**:\n   - Keep track of the maximum size of the window you can maintain while each character outside the window still has at least `k` counts.\n   - The number of minutes required will be the length of the entire string minus the maximum size of the window.\n\n### Pseudocode Outline\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each character in `s`.\n2. If any character count is less than `k`, return `-1`.\n3. Initialize variables: `mx = 0`, `j = 0`, and a sliding window over the string with the right boundary `i`.\n4. For each character at position `i` in the string:\n   - Decrement the count of this character.\n   - If count of any character drops below `k`, move `j` to the right until the count is restored to at least `k`.\n   - Update `mx` with the current maximum window size.\n5. Return the result as the length of the string minus `mx`.\n\n### Final Thought\n\n- Consider edge cases such as strings with minimum length, `k` being zero, which should immediately imply that no characters need to be taken, or strings significantly longer than `k`.\n\nBy understanding and applying these steps, you should be able to solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def takeCharacters(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        cnt = Counter(s)\n        if any(cnt[c] < k for c in \"abc\"):\n            return -1\n        mx = j = 0\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            cnt[c] -= 1\n            while cnt[c] < k:\n                cnt[s[j]] += 1\n                j += 1\n            mx = max(mx, i - j + 1)\n        return len(s) - mx\n", "problem_ids": ["take-k-of-each-character-from-left-and-right"]}, "3151": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\nThe initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\nIf more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    \nIncrease the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.\n        \nFor example, say you start with the words [\"abcdef\",\"abndef\"] both initially abbreviated as \"a4f\".

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "3153": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA cinema\u00a0has n\u00a0rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n\u00a0and there are ten\u00a0seats in each row, labelled from 1\u00a0to 10\u00a0as shown in the figure above.\nGiven the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]\u00a0means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8\u00a0is already reserved.\nReturn the maximum number of four-person groups\u00a0you can assign on the cinema\u00a0seats.

Each row contains 10 seats, and some of these seats are already reserved. Your task is to determine the maximum number of four-person groups that can be seated in the remaining seats such that each group occupies exactly four adjacent seats within the same row. Note that seats are separated by aisles, and a four-person group cannot be split across an aisle except in one specific scenario where an aisle divides the group exactly in the middle, i.e., two people on each side.\n\n#### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Representation of Seats and Rows:**\n    - Each seat can be represented using its row and seat number.\n    - You can use a hash table (or dictionary) to store the rows that have reserved seats. The key in this hash table will be the row number, and the value can be used to track which seats in that row are reserved.\n\n2. **Bit Manipulation for Seat State:**\n    - For each row, represent the reserved seats as a binary number where each bit corresponds to a seat. A bit value of `1` means the seat is reserved, and `0` means it's free.\n    - You can use bit manipulation to update this state efficiently. For example, if seat 3 in row 1 is reserved, you'll set the appropriate bit in the binary representation for row 1.\n\n3. **Initial Calculation:**\n    - For rows that do not appear in your hash table (i.e., no seats are reserved in those rows), you can place two groups of four people directly. Thus, start with an initial count of `2 * (total rows - number of rows with reserved seats)` groups.\n\n4. **Checking Possible Placements in Each Row:**\n    - Define binary masks to represent the possible placements for a four-person group:\n        - `0b0111100000` for seats 2 to 5\n        - `0b0000011110` for seats 4 to 7\n        - `0b0001111000` for seats 6 to 9\n    - For each row that has reserved seats, iterate through these masks and check if those seats are free (i.e., all bits for the mask are `0`). If they are, mark those seats as taken and increment your count of groups.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n    - Sum up the initial group count with the groups found through the mask checks to get the maximum number of four-person groups that can be seated.\n\n#### Detailed Walkthrough\n\n1. **Create a Hash Table:**\n    - Traverse the list of reserved seats. For each reserved seat, update the corresponding row in the hash table with the bitwise representation of the reserved seat.\n\n2. **Initial Group Calculation:**\n    - Compute the initial number of groups by considering all rows with no reserved seats where you can place two groups each.\n\n3. **Check for Four-Person Groups:**\n    - For each row with reserved seats, use bitwise operations to see if any of the defined masks can fit into the row.\n    - If the mask fits (i.e., no reserved seat in that position), update the state to mark these seats as occupied and increase your count of groups.\n\n4. **Iterate and Sum Up:**\n    - Go through all reserved rows and apply the mask checks.\n    - Add the found groups to the initial count to get the final result.\n\nUsing this approach ensures that your solution is efficient and handles the constraints of the problem effectively. By focusing on bitwise operations and leveraging the initial count for unreserved rows, you can solve even large instances of the problem within acceptable time limits.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maxNumberOfFamilies(self, n: int, reservedSeats: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        d = defaultdict(int)\n        for i, j in reservedSeats:\n            d[i] |= 1 << (10 - j)\n        masks = (0b0111100000, 0b0000011110, 0b0001111000)\n        ans = (n - len(d)) * 2\n        for x in d.values():\n            for mask in masks:\n                if (x & mask) == 0:\n                    x |= mask\n                    ans += 1\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["cinema-seat-allocation"]}, "3154": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "3163": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.\nPartition the cards into one or more groups such that:\n\nEach group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and\nAll the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.\n\nReturn true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: No possible partition.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= deck.length <= 104\n0 <= deck[i] < 104\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "3164": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls.

These boards direct balls either to the right or to the left. You will drop a ball into each column from the top, and your task is to determine where each ball will exit from the bottom, or whether it will get stuck.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the right spans the cell from the top-left to bottom-right and is represented as `1`.\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the left spans the cell from the top-right to bottom-left and is represented as `-1`.\n\n2. **Ball Movement and Stuck Conditions:**\n   - If the ball is redirected to the left at the leftmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If the ball is redirected to the right at the rightmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If adjacent cells form a 'V' shape (e.g., current cell is `1` with next cell to the right being `-1` or vice versa), the ball gets stuck.\n\n**Approach to Solution:**\n\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Simulation:**\n   - Create a DFS function to simulate the ball's movement from a given starting position.\n   - Use recursion to determine the ball's path as it moves down the grid.\n\n2. **Base Conditions for Ball Getting Stuck:**\n   - Check if the ball hits the box boundaries or a 'V' shape formed by adjacent boards.\n   - Return `-1` if any of these conditions are met.\n\n3. **Recursive Ball Movement:**\n   - If the ball moves correctly to the next row, recursively apply the DFS to the new position.\n   - When the ball reaches the last row, return the current column as the exit column.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Each Column:**\n   - For each column at the top, initiate the DFS and record the result.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialize Parameters:**\n   - Determine the number of rows `m` and columns `n` of the grid.\n\n2. **Define DFS Function:**\n   - The DFS function takes the current row and column as parameters.\n   - If the ball reaches the last row, return the current column.\n   - Check the following conditions for getting stuck:\n     - Ball tries to move left in the leftmost column, or right in the rightmost column.\n     - Adjacent cells form a 'V' shape.\n   - Recursively move the ball's position based on the board's direction.\n\n3. **Execute DFS for Each Column:**\n   - Iterate over each column at the top and use the DFS function to track the ball's final position or if it gets stuck.\n   - Store the result for each column in an answer list.\n\n4. **Output Results:**\n   - Return the list containing the exit columns or `-1` for each ball.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nConsider the grid:\n```\n[[ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1,  1,  1],\n [ 1,  1,  1,  1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]\n```\nEach ball will be dropped in each column. Using DFS:\n- Ball dropped at column 0 exits at column 1.\n- Ball dropped at column 1 gets stuck in a 'V' shape in columns 2 and 3 in the first or second row.\n- Repeat the process for each column.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nBy following the simulation approach with DFS and handling the boundary and 'V' shape conditions, you can determine the exit column of each ball or identify if it gets stuck. This approach ensures that you comprehensively track the ball's journey through the grid.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def findBall(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:\n            if i == m:\n                return j\n            if j == 0 and grid[i][j] == -1:\n                return -1\n            if j == n - 1 and grid[i][j] == 1:\n                return -1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == -1:\n                return -1\n            if grid[i][j] == -1 and grid[i][j - 1] == 1:\n                return -1\n            return dfs(i + 1, j + 1) if grid[i][j] == 1 else dfs(i + 1, j - 1)\n\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        return [dfs(0, j) for j in range(n)]\n", "problem_ids": ["where-will-the-ball-fall"]}, "3166": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer value.\nIn one operation, you can add or subtract value from any element of nums.\n\nFor example, if nums = [1,2,3] and value = 2, you can choose to subtract value from nums[0] to make nums = [-1,2,3].\n\nThe MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing non-negative integer in it.\n\nFor example, the MEX of [-1,2,3] is 0 while the MEX of [1,0,3] is 2.\n\nReturn the maximum MEX of nums after applying the mentioned operation any number of times.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,-10,7,13,6,8], value = 5\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: One can achieve this result by applying the following operations:\n- Add value to nums[1] twice to make nums = [1,0,7,13,6,8]\n- Subtract value from nums[2] once to make nums = [1,0,2,13,6,8]\n- Subtract value from nums[3] twice to make nums = [1,0,2,3,6,8]\nThe MEX of nums is 4.

Hence, the state of each element modulo `value` is crucial.\n   - For a clearer understanding, divide each element by `value` and consider the remainder.\n\n3. **Count Remainders:**\n   - Create a counting structure (like a hash map or a frequency array) to keep track of how many elements have each possible remainder when divided by `value`.\n\n4. **Simulate Finding the MEX:**\n   - Start checking from `0` upwards to determine the smallest non-negative integer (MEX) that cannot be formed.\n   - For each integer `i`, check if there are sufficient elements with the remainder `i % value`.\n     - If for any `i`, the remainder `i % value` is not present in the counting structure, this `i` is the MEX.\n\n5. **Update the Counter:**\n   - As you check each integer `i`, if the remainder `i % value` is present, decrement the count for that remainder, since you are attempting to \"use\" one instance of an element that produces this remainder.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Counter:**\n   - Create a counter for remainders when elements of `nums` are divided by `value`.\n\n2. **Fill the Counter:**\n   - Traverse through `nums` and for each element, compute its remainder when divided by `value` and increment the corresponding count in the counter.\n\n3. **Determine the MEX:**\n   - Start from `0` and iterate upwards.\n   - For each `i`, calculate `i % value`.\n   - Check if the counter entry for `i % value` is greater than `0`. If not, then `i` is the MEX.\n   - If it is, decrement the counter for `i % value` and move to the next integer.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider `nums = [1, -10, 7, 13, 6, 8]` and `value = 5`.\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Count remainders when divided by `5`.\n\n2. **Counting Remainders:**\n   - Remainders: `1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3` \u2192 Counter: `{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2}`\n\n3. **Finding MEX:**\n   - `i = 0` \u2192 Check `cnt[0 % 5] = 1` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 1` \u2192 Check `cnt[1 % 5] = 2` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 2` \u2192 Check `cnt[2 % 5] = 1` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 3` \u2192 Check `cnt[3 % 5] = 2` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 4` \u2192 `cnt[4 % 5] = 0` \u2192 Not present \u2192 Maximum MEX = `4`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBy counting the occurrences of each remainder and systematically checking each possible integer starting from `0`, you can efficiently determine the MEX after performing any sequence of operations. This approach ensures you can find the maximum possible MEX in an optimal way.\n\nGood luck, and happy coding!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def findSmallestInteger(self, nums: List[int], value: int) -> int:\n        cnt = Counter(x % value for x in nums)\n        for i in range(len(nums) + 1):\n            if cnt[i % value] == 0:\n                return i\n            cnt[i % value] -= 1\n", "problem_ids": ["smallest-missing-non-negative-integer-after-operations"]}, "3171": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\nThe initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\nIf more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    \nIncrease the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.\n        \nFor example, say you start with the words [\"abcdef\",\"abndef\"] both initially abbreviated as \"a4f\".

Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "3172": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer n and an integer start.\nDefine an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2 * i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.\nReturn the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, start = 0\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.\nWhere \"^\" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, start = 3\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= start <= 1000\nn == nums.length\n\n Solution: \n## How to Solve the XOR Operation Problem: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIn this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to solve a problem involving the bitwise XOR operation on elements of an array. Let's break down the problem and tackle it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given two integers, `n` and `start`. Using these, you need to construct an array `nums` where each element is defined as follows:\n- `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (where `i` is the index of the element, starting from 0).\n\nFor instance, if `n = 5` and `start = 0`:\n- `nums` would be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n\nYour task is to return the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the `nums` array. \n\nBitwise XOR is a binary operation that follows these rules:\n- 0 XOR 0 = 0\n- 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nFollow the steps below to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize an Array to Store the Elements**: \n\n   Create an array `nums` where each element is calculated using the formula `nums[i] = start + 2 * i`. This array is defined for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Element**:\n\n   Iterate through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and calculate the value of `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Compute the XOR for All Elements**:\n\n   Initialize a variable to store the XOR result. As you iterate over the elements of the array, update this variable by XORing it with each element. This can be done using a loop.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Create the Array**:\n   - Declare an array called `nums` with a length of `n`.\n   - Loop from `0` to `n-1` to fill the array, where each element `nums[i]` is calculated as `start + 2 * i`.\n\n2. **Calculate XOR**:\n   - Initialize a variable, say `xor_result`, to `0`. This will store our final XOR result.\n   - Loop through the `nums` array and update `xor_result` by performing the XOR operation with each `nums[i]`. Essentially, `xor_result` becomes `xor_result ^ nums[i]` for each element `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, the variable `xor_result` will contain the final XOR result of all elements in the array.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's consider an example to make the explanation clearer.\n\n**Example 1**:\n- Input: `n = 5`, `start = 0`\n- Create the array `nums`:\n  - When `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 0 + 2 * 0 = 0`\n  - When `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2`\n  - When `i = 2`, `nums[2] = 0 + 2 * 2 = 4`\n  - When `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 0 + 2 * 3 = 6`\n  - When `i = 4`, `nums[4] = 0 + 2 * 4 = 8`\n- The array `nums` will be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n- Calculate the XOR of all elements:\n  - `result = 0 ^ 0 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 2 = 2`\n  - `result = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n  - `result = 6 ^ 6 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 8 = 8`\n- The final result is `8`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem and find the XOR of all elements in the `nums` array.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:\n        return reduce(xor, ((start + 2 * i) for i in range(n)))\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-operation-in-an-array"]}, "3174": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)\n\nP   A   H   N\nA P L S I I G\nY   I   R\n\nAnd then read line by line: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\nWrite the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:\n\nstring convert(string s, int numRows);\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 3\nOutput: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4\nOutput: \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\nExplanation:\nP     I    N\nA   L S  I G\nY A   H R\nP     I\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"A\", numRows = 1\nOutput: \"A\"\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.\n1 <= numRows <= 1000\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Zigzag Pattern Conversion Problem\n\nTo solve the problem of converting a given string into a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows and then reading it line-by-line to form the final output, follow these detailed steps:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Understand the Zigzag Pattern:**\n   - The zigzag pattern involves writing characters in a diagonal fashion on a set number of rows and then reading the characters row-wise.\n   - For example, with the string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" and 3 rows, the pattern would look like this:\n     ```\n     P   A   H   N\n     A P L S I I G\n     Y   I   R\n     ```\n\n2. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the number of rows is 1, the output is the string itself because there is no zigzag pattern in a single row.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach:**\n   - Represent the zigzag structure using a list of lists (`g`). Each sublist will hold characters that belong to a specific row.\n   - Initialize variables:\n     - `i`: Tracks the current row index.\n     - `k`: A direction indicator (initially set to `-1` to represent upward movement).\n   - Traverse the string character by character. Append each character to the appropriate row in `g` based on the current value of `i`.\n\n4. **Direction Control:**\n   - Adjust the value of `i` and `k` to simulate the zigzag movement:\n     - If you are at the top row (`i == 0`) or the bottom row (`i == numRows - 1`), reverse the direction (`k = -k`).\n     - Update `i` by adding `k` (move up or down accordingly).\n\n5. **Collect the Result:**\n   - Once all characters have been added to the appropriate rows, concatenate all rows to form the final string by joining all sublists in `g`.\n\n#### Detailed Steps for Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a list of `numRows` empty lists (`g`).\n   - Set `i` to `0` (starting at the first row).\n   - Set `k` to `-1` (initial direction is upward).\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String:**\n   - For each character in the string:\n     - Append the character to the current row (`g[i]`).\n     - If you are at the first row (`i == 0`) or the last row (`i == numRows - 1`), multiply `k` by `-1` to change direction.\n     - Increment or decrement `i` by `k` to move to the next row accordingly.\n\n3. **Concatenate Rows:**\n   - After all characters are processed, each sublist in `g` contains the characters of a zigzag row.\n   - Combine all sublists into a single string and return this as the result.\n\n### Example to Clarify the Process\n\nLet's take an example to clarify:\n\n**Input:** `s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4`\n\n1. **Pattern Formation:**\n\n   ```\n   P     I    N\n   A   L S  I G\n   Y A   H R\n   P     I\n   ```\n\n2. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Initialize `g` with 4 empty lists.\n   - Traverse the string and distribute characters according to the zigzag pattern:\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 0.\n     - Traverse \"A\", add to row 1.\n     - Traverse \"Y\", add to row 2.\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 3 (Reverse direction here).\n     - Continue following the described rules.\n\n3. **Result Compilation:**\n   - After processing all characters, concatenate the rows:\n     ```\n     P + I + N + A + L + S + I + G + Y + A + H + R + P + I  => \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\n     ```\n   - Return the concatenated string as the final output.\n\n### Summary\nBy systematically simulating the zigzag pattern, updating row indices, and reversing direction at appropriate points, you can effectively convert the given string to the required format and compile the final output. This approach handles edge cases and ensures an efficient solution.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:\n        if numRows == 1:\n            return s\n        g = [[] for _ in range(numRows)]\n        i, k = 0, -1\n        for c in s:\n            g[i].append(c)\n            if i == 0 or i == numRows - 1:\n                k = -k\n            i += k\n        return ''.join(chain(*g))\n", "problem_ids": ["zigzag-conversion"]}, "3176": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1.

Here's a detailed guide to help you solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirstly, let's ensure we understand the key requirements:\n- You need to initialize a data structure with an array.\n- For a given subarray (specified by its left and right indices), you need to find an element that appears at least a specified number of times (given as threshold).\n- If no such element exists, you should return -1.\n\n### Step 2: Key Concepts and Strategy\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, you can use a combination of data structures and algorithms:\n1. **Segment Tree**: For efficient range queries.\n2. **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**: For identifying potential majority candidates in linear time.\n3. **Binary Search**: For quickly counting occurrences within a subarray.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Segment Tree Structure\n\nA segment tree will help you divide the array into manageable segments, each represented as a node containing:\n- `l` and `r`: The left and right endpoints of the segment.\n- `x`: The candidate majority element for the segment.\n- `cnt`: The count of occurrences of the candidate majority element in the segment.\n\n### Step 4: Segment Tree Operations\n\nYou need to implement several operations for the segment tree:\n- **Build Operation**: To initialize and construct the segment tree with the array.\n- **Pushup Operation**: To consolidate information from child nodes to parent nodes.\n- **Query Operation**: To fetch candidate majority elements and their counts for any segment.\n\n### Step 5: Initialization\n\nWhen initializing the data structure:\n1. **Build the Segment Tree** using the input array.\n2. **Create a Hash Map** to store the indices of each element in the array for quick lookup later.\n\n### Step 6: Querying the Majority Element\n\nFor a given query:\n1. Use the segment tree to get a candidate majority element (if any) for the specified range.\n2. Use binary search on the hash map entries to quickly count the occurrences of this candidate within the range.\n3. If the count meets or exceeds the threshold, return the candidate; otherwise, return -1.\n\n### Step 7: Handling Specific Queries\n\nEnsure that when processing each query:\n- Transform the 1-based indices used internally by the segment tree to the 0-based indices typical in standard array indexing.\n- Leverage the hash map and binary search to quickly count elements in the subarray.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n1. **Define the Node Structure**: Create a class to represent each node of the segment tree.\n2. **Build the Segment Tree**: Recursively build segments, initializing leaf segments directly with array values and computing parent nodes by combining child nodes' data.\n3. **Pushup Logic**: Determine the majority candidate for a node by comparing child nodes.\n4. **Query the Segment Tree**: Implement logic to query any segment efficiently.\n5. **Binary Search for Count**: Use binary search to count occurrences of a candidate majority element within the specified range.\n6. **Integration in MajorityChecker Class**: Combine the segment tree operations and hash map into the `MajorityChecker` class.\n\n### Example Workflow\n\nConsider an array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]`:\n1. **Initialization**: Build the segment tree and prepare the hash map.\n2. **Query Execution**: For queries like `(0, 5, 4)`, fetch the majority candidate from the tree and verify occurrence using the hash map.\n\nBy understanding and following these structured steps, you will be able to efficiently solve the Majority Element Checker problem.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Node:\n    __slots__ = (\"l\", \"r\", \"x\", \"cnt\")\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.l = self.r = 0\n        self.x = self.cnt = 0\n\n\nclass SegmentTree:\n    def __init__(self, nums):\n        self.nums = nums\n        n = len(nums)\n        self.tr = [Node() for _ in range(n << 2)]\n        self.build(1, 1, n)\n\n    def build(self, u, l, r):\n        self.tr[u].l, self.tr[u].r = l, r\n        if l == r:\n            self.tr[u].x = self.nums[l - 1]\n            self.tr[u].cnt = 1\n            return\n        mid = (l + r) >> 1\n        self.build(u << 1, l, mid)\n        self.build(u << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r)\n        self.pushup(u)\n\n    def query(self, u, l, r):\n        if self.tr[u].l >= l and self.tr[u].r <= r:\n            return self.tr[u].x, self.tr[u].cnt\n        mid = (self.tr[u].l + self.tr[u].r) >> 1\n        if r <= mid:\n            return self.query(u << 1, l, r)\n        if l > mid:\n            return self.query(u << 1 | 1, l, r)\n        x1, cnt1 = self.query(u << 1, l, r)\n        x2, cnt2 = self.query(u << 1 | 1, l, r)\n        if x1 == x2:\n            return x1, cnt1 + cnt2\n        if cnt1 >= cnt2:\n            return x1, cnt1 - cnt2\n        else:\n            return x2, cnt2 - cnt1\n\n    def pushup(self, u):\n        if self.tr[u << 1].x == self.tr[u << 1 | 1].x:\n            self.tr[u].x = self.tr[u << 1].x\n            self.tr[u].cnt = self.tr[u << 1].cnt + self.tr[u << 1 | 1].cnt\n        elif self.tr[u << 1].cnt >= self.tr[u << 1 | 1].cnt:\n            self.tr[u].x = self.tr[u << 1].x\n            self.tr[u].cnt = self.tr[u << 1].cnt - self.tr[u << 1 | 1].cnt\n        else:\n            self.tr[u].x = self.tr[u << 1 | 1].x\n            self.tr[u].cnt = self.tr[u << 1 | 1].cnt - self.tr[u << 1].cnt\n\n\nclass MajorityChecker:\n    def __init__(self, arr: List[int]):\n        self.tree = SegmentTree(arr)\n        self.d = defaultdict(list)\n        for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n            self.d[x].append(i)\n\n    def query(self, left: int, right: int, threshold: int) -> int:\n        x, _ = self.tree.query(1, left + 1, right + 1)\n        l = bisect_left(self.d[x], left)\n        r = bisect_left(self.d[x], right + 1)\n        return x if r - l >= threshold else -1\n\n\n# Your MajorityChecker object will be instantiated and called as such:\n# obj = MajorityChecker(arr)\n# param_1 = obj.query(left,right,threshold)\n", "problem_ids": ["online-majority-element-in-subarray"]}, "3188": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.\nThe word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring.

Follow these steps carefully to understand the process:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**\n   - We're given an `m x n` grid consisting of characters and a word. \n   - The task is to determine if the word can be constructed by sequentially adjacent cells in the grid. Adjacency here refers to cells that are horizontally or vertically neighboring.\n   - Note that a cell may not be used more than once in constructing the word.\n\n2. **Conceptualize the Solution:**\n   - We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from each cell in the grid. \n   - Through DFS, we'll check if we can form the word by moving to adjacent cells.\n   - Backtracking will be used to ensure we do not use the same cell more than once.\n\n3. **Design the DFS Function:**\n   - The DFS function should take three parameters: the current indices of the grid cell (i, j) and the index of the character in the word (k) that we are currently trying to match.\n   - The function will return `True` if it successfully matches the entire word starting from the cell (i, j).\n\n4. **DFS Function Details:**\n   - **Base Case:** If `k` is equal to the last index of the word, check if the character at cell (i, j) is equal to the last character of the word. If it matches, return `True`.\n   - **Invalid Case:** If the character at cell (i, j) does not match the k-th character in the word, return `False`.\n   - **Move Forward:** If it is a valid match:\n     1. Temporarily mark the current cell as visited by replacing its content with a special character (e.g., '0').\n     2. Attempt to move to one of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and check if the next character matches.\n     3. If any of the moves leads to a successful match, return `True`.\n     4. Restore the cell's original character before returning to ensure no permanent modifications.\n\n5. **Implement the Search for All Cells:**\n   - Iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, call the DFS function starting with `k=0` (first character of the word).\n   - If any DFS call returns `True`, the word exists in the grid. If none return `True`, the word does not exist.\n\n### Practical Implementation Without Code:\n\n1. **Initialize the Search:**\n   - Loop through each cell `(i, j)` in the grid.\n   \n2. **Start DFS from Each Cell:**\n   - For each cell, invoke the DFS function starting from `(i, j)` and `k = 0` (the first character of the word).\n\n3. **DFS Traversal:**\n   - Check if the character at `(i, j)` matches the k-th character in the word.\n   - If a match is found, temporarily mark the cell as visited.\n   - Move to each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - Ensure the new positions are within grid bounds and the next cell is not visited.\n   - Recursively call DFS for the new cell and the next character of the word.\n   - If all characters of the word are matched during the DFS traversal, return `True`.\n   - Unmark the cell (revert to original character) before returning from DFS.\n   \n4. **Return the Result:**\n   - If DFS returns `True` for any cell, the word exists in the grid.\n   - If no starting cell leads to a successful match, return `False`.\n\n### Optimization Considerations:\n\n- **Search Pruning:** To make the solution faster, avoid exploring paths where the remaining characters in the grid are insufficient to complete the word.\n- **Early Termination:** As soon as you find a valid path that forms the word, stop further processing.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\n- For the grid:\n  ```\n  [[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\"],\n   [\"S\", \"F\", \"C\", \"S\"],\n   [\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"E\"]]\n  ```\n  and word `\"ABCCED\"`, start at cell `(0, 0)` which matches 'A', and use DFS to explore its neighbors to match 'B', then 'C', continuing this process till you match the entire word or backtrack if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement a solution that checks whether a given word can be constructed from a grid of characters using DFS and backtracking.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int, k: int) -> bool:\n            if k == len(word) - 1:\n                return board[i][j] == word[k]\n            if board[i][j] != word[k]:\n                return False\n            c = board[i][j]\n            board[i][j] = \"0\"\n            for a, b in pairwise((-1, 0, 1, 0, -1)):\n                x, y = i + a, j + b\n                ok = 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and board[x][y] != \"0\"\n                if ok and dfs(x, y, k + 1):\n                    return True\n            board[i][j] = c\n            return False\n\n        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])\n        return any(dfs(i, j, 0) for i in range(m) for j in range(n))\n", "problem_ids": ["word-search"]}, "3190": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.\n\nFor example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.\n\nGiven an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.\u00a0\nNote: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.\nAn array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [3] has an XOR total of 3.\n- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.\n0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,1,6]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [5] has an XOR total of 5.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [6] has an XOR total of 6.\n- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.\n- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.\n- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.\n- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.\n0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]\nOutput: 480\nExplanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 12\n1 <= nums[i] <= 20\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through how to solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe need to compute the sum of all XOR totals for every possible subset of a given array `nums`. XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares each bit of its operands. For instance, the XOR of 2 (0010 in binary) and 5 (0101 in binary) is 7 (0111 in binary).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Represent Subsets Using Binary Numbers\n- Each subset of an array can be represented by a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included in the subset (1) or not (0).\n- For example, an array `[a, b, c]` has its subsets represented by:\n  - `000` (empty subset)\n  - `001` (subset with only `c`)\n  - `010` (subset with only `b`)\n  - `011` (subset with `b` and `c`)\n  - and so on.\n\n#### 2. Enumerate All Subsets\n- You can enumerate all subsets by considering all binary numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. In binary form, each number in this range corresponds to a subset.\n\n#### 3. Calculate XOR for Each Subset\n- For each subset represented by binary number `i`, check each bit position. Include the element in the subset if the bit is `1`.\n- Compute the XOR for all included elements.\n\n#### 4. Sum All XOR Results\n- Maintain a running total of the XOR results from all subsets. \n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Create a variable to store the total sum of all XOR results.\n\n2. **Loop Through All Possible Subsets:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through all integers from `0` to `2^n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Each Element:**\n   - For each subset, check each bit of the current integer:\n     - If the bit at position `j` is `1`, include the `j`-th element of `nums` in the subset.\n\n4. **Compute XOR for the Current Subset:**\n   - Initialize a variable for the current XOR total. For each `1` bit found, XOR it with the current total.\n\n5. **Add the XOR Result to Total:**\n   - After computing the XOR for the current subset, add it to the running total.\n\n6. **Return the Total Sum:**\n   - Once all subsets are processed, return the running total.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's say the array is `[1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `total_sum = 0`\n\n2. **Generate Subsets:**\n   - The length `n = 2`, so iterate over `i` from `0` to `3` (`2^2 - 1`).\n\n3. **Subset by `i = 0` (`00` in binary):**\n   - No elements included. XOR total = `0`.\n   - Add `0` to `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Subset by `i = 1` (`01` in binary):**\n   - Include element `1`. XOR total = `1`.\n   - Add `1` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 1`.\n\n5. **Subset by `i = 2` (`10` in binary):**\n   - Include element `3`. XOR total = `3`.\n   - Add `3` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 4`.\n\n6. **Subset by `i = 3` (`11` in binary):**\n   - Include elements `1` and `3`. XOR total = `1 XOR 3 = 2`.\n   - Add `2` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 6`.\n\nFinal output is `6`, as the sum of all XOR totals for every subset is `6`.\n\nUsing this structured approach will help you understand and solve the problem efficiently.

Let's break down the problem and tackle it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given two integers, `n` and `start`. Using these, you need to construct an array `nums` where each element is defined as follows:\n- `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (where `i` is the index of the element, starting from 0).\n\nFor instance, if `n = 5` and `start = 0`:\n- `nums` would be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n\nYour task is to return the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the `nums` array. \n\nBitwise XOR is a binary operation that follows these rules:\n- 0 XOR 0 = 0\n- 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nFollow the steps below to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize an Array to Store the Elements**: \n\n   Create an array `nums` where each element is calculated using the formula `nums[i] = start + 2 * i`. This array is defined for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Element**:\n\n   Iterate through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and calculate the value of `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Compute the XOR for All Elements**:\n\n   Initialize a variable to store the XOR result. As you iterate over the elements of the array, update this variable by XORing it with each element. This can be done using a loop.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Create the Array**:\n   - Declare an array called `nums` with a length of `n`.\n   - Loop from `0` to `n-1` to fill the array, where each element `nums[i]` is calculated as `start + 2 * i`.\n\n2. **Calculate XOR**:\n   - Initialize a variable, say `xor_result`, to `0`. This will store our final XOR result.\n   - Loop through the `nums` array and update `xor_result` by performing the XOR operation with each `nums[i]`. Essentially, `xor_result` becomes `xor_result ^ nums[i]` for each element `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, the variable `xor_result` will contain the final XOR result of all elements in the array.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's consider an example to make the explanation clearer.\n\n**Example 1**:\n- Input: `n = 5`, `start = 0`\n- Create the array `nums`:\n  - When `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 0 + 2 * 0 = 0`\n  - When `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2`\n  - When `i = 2`, `nums[2] = 0 + 2 * 2 = 4`\n  - When `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 0 + 2 * 3 = 6`\n  - When `i = 4`, `nums[4] = 0 + 2 * 4 = 8`\n- The array `nums` will be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n- Calculate the XOR of all elements:\n  - `result = 0 ^ 0 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 2 = 2`\n  - `result = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n  - `result = 6 ^ 6 = 0`\n  - `result = 0 ^ 8 = 8`\n- The final result is `8`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem and find the XOR of all elements in the `nums` array.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:\n        return reduce(xor, ((start + 2 * i) for i in range(n)))\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-operation-in-an-array"]}, "3193": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

Here is a step-by-step guide to help you solve the problem:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe task is to find the maximum bitwise XOR value from all possible strong pairs in an array. A strong pair \\((x, y)\\) satisfies the condition \\( |x - y| \\leq \\min(x, y) \\). \n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n1. **Understanding the Strong Pair Condition**: The condition \\( |x - y| \\leq \\min(x, y) \\) means that the absolute difference between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) should not exceed the smaller of the two values. For simplicity and without loss of generality, assume \\(x \\leq y\\). Then the condition reduces to \\( y - x \\leq x \\) which further simplifies to \\( y \\leq 2x \\).\n  \n2. **Goal**: Select two integers from the array such that they form a strong pair and their XOR is maximum.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Sorting the Array**: Start by sorting the array. Sorting simplifies the search for pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the condition \\( y \\leq 2x \\).\n\n2. **Using Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window of valid \\(x\\) values for each \\(y\\). As you enumerate through each element \\(y\\) in the sorted array, you adjust the window of \\(x\\) values to ensure all \\(x\\) in the window satisfy the strong pair condition with \\(y\\).\n\n3. **Binary Trie for Fast XOR Calculation**:\n    - Implement a binary trie (prefix tree) to store numbers in the current window. This trie allows efficient maximal XOR queries.\n    - Insert \\(y\\) into the trie before processing it, and remove any \\(x\\) values from the trie that no longer satisfy \\(y \\leq 2x\\).\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum XOR**: For each \\(y\\), query the trie to find the maximum XOR of \\(y\\) with any \\(x\\) in the current window. Update the result if the current XOR is the highest encountered.\n\n### Detailed Guide\n1. **Sort the Array**:\n   - Sorting ensures that when you process \\(y\\), all subsequent elements are greater than or equal to \\(y\\).\n\n2. **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**:\n   - Use one pointer to iterate through each number \\(y\\) in the sorted array.\n   - Use another pointer to manage the left end of the sliding window to maintain the condition \\( y \\leq 2x \\).\n   \n3. **Binary Trie Operations**:\n   - **Insertion**: Insert each \\(y\\) into the trie.\n   - **Search**: Implement a function to query the maximum XOR value of \\(y\\) against the elements in the trie.\n   - **Deletion**: Remove elements from the trie which no longer form strong pairs with the current \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Updating the Result**:\n   - For each \\(y\\), perform the XOR calculation and keep track of the maximum XOR value found.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\nConsider the array \\([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\):\n- **Sorting**: Sorted array is \\([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\).\n- **Two Pointers**: \n  - Process \\(1\\): Add to trie, no pairs to remove.\n  - Process \\(2\\): Add to trie, still no pairs to remove.\n  - Process \\(3\\): Add to trie, start removing elements where \\( 2 \\times x < 3 \\) (i.e., no elements to remove yet).\n  - Continue this until all elements have been processed.\n- **Trie Operations**:\n  - Insert each element into the trie.\n  - Find the maximum XOR for each element while the window of valid pairs is adjusted.\n  - Remove elements as they no longer form strong pairs.\n\n### Final Note\nThis approach ensures the solution is efficient in terms of time complexity \\(O(n \\log M)\\) and space complexity \\(O(n \\log M)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the array and \\(M\\) is the maximum value in the array.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to implement the solution and solve the problem effectively.

We need to return these words in the same order they appear in `queries`.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Both `queries` and `dictionary` contain words of the same length.\n   - We can change any letter in a word from `queries` to any other letter, and we need to determine if it can match a word from `dictionary` with at most two such changes.\n   - The goal is to return a list of words from `queries` that meet this criterion.\n\n2. **Plan the Solution:**\n   - For each word in `queries`, compare it with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - Count the number of differing letters between each pair of words.\n   - If the count of differing letters is less than or equal to two, record the word from `queries`.\n\n3. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the words from `queries` that can match with words from `dictionary` with up to two edits.\n   - Use nested loops to compare each word in `queries` with each word in `dictionary`.\n   - For this comparison, iterate through the letters of both words simultaneously and count the differences.\n   - If the differences are two or fewer, add the word from `queries` to the result list and break out of the inner loop (since one match is enough).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations:**\n   - The time complexity is determined by the number of comparisons we make between the words.\n   - Each word comparison takes linear time relative to the word length.\n   - Given that the lengths of `queries` and `dictionary` can each be up to 100 and the word length can be up to 100, ensure your approach can handle the worst-case scenario efficiently.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider the following example:\n```python\nqueries = [\"word\", \"note\", \"ants\", \"wood\"]\ndictionary = [\"wood\", \"joke\", \"moat\"]\n```\n- Compare \"word\" with \"wood\": One edit needed ('r' to 'o'), so \"word\" matches.\n- Compare \"note\" with \"joke\": Two edits needed ('n' to 'j' and 't' to 'k'), so \"note\" matches.\n- Compare \"ants\" with all dictionary words: Requires more than two edits for each, so \"ants\" does not match.\n- Compare \"wood\" with \"wood\": No edits needed, so \"wood\" matches.\n\nThus, the output is `[\"word\", \"note\", \"wood\"]`.\n\n#### Algorithm Pseudocode:\n\n```text\ninitialize an empty list result\n\nfor each word s in queries:\n    for each word t in dictionary:\n        count differences between s and t\n        if differences are <= 2:\n            add s to result\n            break out of inner loop\n\nreturn result\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Ensure you correctly understand how to count the number of letter differences between two words efficiently.\n- Be mindful of the break condition in the inner loop \u2013 it helps avoid unnecessary comparisons once a match is found.\n- Use list comprehensions and Python's built-in functions efficiently for counting and managing iterations.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to implement a solution that identifies all words in `queries` that can be transformed into any word in `dictionary` with at most two edits.

Here is a step-by-step natural language guide to help a student solve the problem of determining whether a string can become a palindrome by deleting at most one character:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solving the Problem:\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nThe problem asks you to determine if a given string can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most one character. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as \"racecar\" or \"madam.\"\n\n#### Approach:\nThe goal is to use a two-pointer technique to efficiently check if the string can be made into a palindrome with at most one deletion.\n\n1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**\n   - Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the string. These pointers will be used to compare characters from both ends towards the middle.\n\n2. **Compare Characters:**\n   - Compare the characters at the positions of the two pointers.\n   - If the characters are the same, move the left pointer one step to the right and the right pointer one step to the left, and continue the comparison.\n\n3. **Handle Mismatches:**\n   - If the characters at the pointers do not match, you have two potential cases to handle:\n     1. **Skip the Character at the Left Pointer:** Check if the remaining substring (excluding the current character at the left pointer) can form a palindrome.\n     2. **Skip the Character at the Right Pointer:** Check if the remaining substring (excluding the current character at the right pointer) can form a palindrome.\n   - If either skipping the left character or the right character results in a palindrome, the answer is true.\n\n4. **Check Substrings:**\n   - To check if a substring is a palindrome, you can use a helper function or manual checks where you iterate through the substring using two pointers and compare characters from both ends towards the center.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - If you can adjust the string to form a palindrome by skipping at most one character, return true. Otherwise, return false.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n\n**Example 1:** \n- Input: \"aba\"\n- Output: true\n- The string \"aba\" is already a palindrome, so no deletions are needed.\n\n**Example 2:** \n- Input: \"abca\"\n- Output: true\n- By removing the character 'c', the string becomes \"aba\", which is a palindrome.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: \"abc\"\n- Output: false\n- There is no way to remove just one character to make \"abc\" a palindrome.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- **Efficiency:** The two-pointer technique ensures that you only need to traverse the string up to twice (once for the full check and once for each potential skip), resulting in linear time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n- **Space Complexity:** You only need a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the possible recursive calls, resulting in O(1) space complexity.\n\nBy following these steps and using logic to handle mismatches and verify potential palindromes, you can solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:\n        def check(i, j):\n            while i < j:\n                if s[i] != s[j]:\n                    return False\n                i, j = i + 1, j - 1\n            return True\n\n        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n        while i < j:\n            if s[i] != s[j]:\n                return check(i, j - 1) or check(i + 1, j)\n            i, j = i + 1, j - 1\n        return True\n", "problem_ids": ["valid-palindrome-ii"]}, "3196": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.\nYou are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

Let's walk through a detailed guide to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing a limited number of increment operations on an array.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Frequency Definition**: The frequency of an element in an array is the number of times that element appears in the array.\n2. **Operations Allowed**: You can choose an index in the array and increment the element at that index by 1. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.\n3. **Goal**: After at most `k` operations, determine the maximum frequency of any element in the array.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Element Choice**: The element with the highest post-operation frequency must be one of the elements from the original array.\n2. **Continuous Subarray**: To maximize frequency, the elements chosen for the increment operations are in a continuous subarray in the sorted version of the array.\n3. **Binary Search Application**: If a certain frequency is achievable, then any lower frequency is also achievable. This insight suggests using binary search to effectively find the maximum frequency.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the given array in non-decreasing order. This helps in easily forming and analyzing continuous subarrays.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Create a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sorted array. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of elements in any subarray.\n\n3. **Binary Search Setup**: \n    - Set the initial left boundary (`l`) of the binary search to 1 and the right boundary (`r`) to the length of the array.\n    - In each step of the binary search, check the midpoint (`mid`) for whether it's possible to achieve a frequency of `mid` with the given number of operations (`k`).\n\n4. **Check Feasibility of Achieving a Frequency**: \n    - For a given subarray of length `m` (midpoint value in binary search), compute the total number of operations needed to make all elements in the subarray equal to the maximum element of that subarray.\n    - This is done by calculating if `max_element * m - sum_of_subarray` is less than or equal to `k`.\n    - If yes, it means achieving this frequency is feasible; otherwise, it's not.\n\n5. **Adjust Binary Search Boundaries**:\n    - If the frequency `m` is feasible, move the left boundary up to `m`.\n    - If not feasible, move the right boundary down to `m - 1`.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n    - The maximum frequency will be in the left boundary (`l`) after the binary search completes.\n\n### Pseudo-Implementation\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: `nums.sort()`\n2. **Create Prefix Sum Array**: Use cumulative sum to create an array `s` where `s[i]` denotes the sum of the first `i` elements.\n3. **Binary Search**:\n    - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = len(nums)`\n    - Define a function to check feasibility of a given frequency `m`.\n    - Perform binary search using the feasibility function and adjust boundaries accordingly.\n4. **Return the Left Boundary**: When binary search completes, `l` will give the maximum possible frequency.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThis problem combines sorting, prefix sum calculations, and binary search \u2014 all standard yet powerful techniques. The crux of the solution lies in efficiently determining whether a certain frequency can be achieved with the given number of operations, leveraging prefix sums to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the key insights, you can confidently approach and solve the problem.

Let's walk through how to solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe need to compute the sum of all XOR totals for every possible subset of a given array `nums`. XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares each bit of its operands. For instance, the XOR of 2 (0010 in binary) and 5 (0101 in binary) is 7 (0111 in binary).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Represent Subsets Using Binary Numbers\n- Each subset of an array can be represented by a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included in the subset (1) or not (0).\n- For example, an array `[a, b, c]` has its subsets represented by:\n  - `000` (empty subset)\n  - `001` (subset with only `c`)\n  - `010` (subset with only `b`)\n  - `011` (subset with `b` and `c`)\n  - and so on.\n\n#### 2. Enumerate All Subsets\n- You can enumerate all subsets by considering all binary numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. In binary form, each number in this range corresponds to a subset.\n\n#### 3. Calculate XOR for Each Subset\n- For each subset represented by binary number `i`, check each bit position. Include the element in the subset if the bit is `1`.\n- Compute the XOR for all included elements.\n\n#### 4. Sum All XOR Results\n- Maintain a running total of the XOR results from all subsets. \n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Create a variable to store the total sum of all XOR results.\n\n2. **Loop Through All Possible Subsets:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through all integers from `0` to `2^n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Each Element:**\n   - For each subset, check each bit of the current integer:\n     - If the bit at position `j` is `1`, include the `j`-th element of `nums` in the subset.\n\n4. **Compute XOR for the Current Subset:**\n   - Initialize a variable for the current XOR total. For each `1` bit found, XOR it with the current total.\n\n5. **Add the XOR Result to Total:**\n   - After computing the XOR for the current subset, add it to the running total.\n\n6. **Return the Total Sum:**\n   - Once all subsets are processed, return the running total.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's say the array is `[1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `total_sum = 0`\n\n2. **Generate Subsets:**\n   - The length `n = 2`, so iterate over `i` from `0` to `3` (`2^2 - 1`).\n\n3. **Subset by `i = 0` (`00` in binary):**\n   - No elements included. XOR total = `0`.\n   - Add `0` to `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Subset by `i = 1` (`01` in binary):**\n   - Include element `1`. XOR total = `1`.\n   - Add `1` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 1`.\n\n5. **Subset by `i = 2` (`10` in binary):**\n   - Include element `3`. XOR total = `3`.\n   - Add `3` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 4`.\n\n6. **Subset by `i = 3` (`11` in binary):**\n   - Include elements `1` and `3`. XOR total = `1 XOR 3 = 2`.\n   - Add `2` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 6`.\n\nFinal output is `6`, as the sum of all XOR totals for every subset is `6`.\n\nUsing this structured approach will help you understand and solve the problem efficiently.

Here's a detailed natural language guide for solving the problem:\n\n---\n\n### Guide to Solving the Unique Paths Problem\n\nImagine you have a robot starting at the top-left corner of an \\(m \\times n\\) grid. The robot's goal is to reach the bottom-right corner. The robot can only move right (\u2192) or down (\u2193). You need to determine the number of unique paths the robot can take to get from the start to the end.\n\nHere's how you can approach this problem step-by-step using dynamic programming:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n    - The robot starts at grid cell (0, 0).\n    - The destination is grid cell (m-1, n-1).\n    - The robot can only move right or down.\n    - You need to count all the unique ways to move from the start to the goal.\n\n2. **Define State Variables**:\n    - Let's use a 2D list (or array) called `f` where `f[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to the cell (i, j).\n\n3. **Initialization**:\n    - The starting point `(0, 0)` has only one path to itself, so set `f[0][0] = 1`.\n\n4. **State Transition**:\n    - For each cell `(i, j)`, you can reach it either from the cell above it `(i-1, j)` or from the cell to the left of it `(i, j-1)`.\n    - Thus, the number of paths to `(i, j)` is the sum of the paths to `(i-1, j)` and `(i, j-1)`.\n    - Formally, this can be written as:\n      - `f[i][j] = f[i-1][j]` if `i > 0` (paths coming from above)\n      - `f[i][j] += f[i][j-1]` if `j > 0` (paths coming from the left)\n\n5. **Iterate Over the Grid**:\n    - Start from the top-left corner and iteratively fill in the number of paths for each cell using the transition defined above.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n    - The number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner will be stored in `f[m-1][n-1]`.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**:\n    - Create a 2D list `f` with dimensions `m x n`, initialized to 0.\n\n2. **Set the Starting Point**:\n    - Set `f[0][0] = 1`.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid Using State Transitions**:\n    - Loop through each cell `(i, j)` of the grid:\n        - If `i > 0` (not in the first row), update `f[i][j]` by adding the value from the cell above it: `f[i][j] += f[i-1][j]`.\n        - If `j > 0` (not in the first column), update `f[i][j]` by adding the value from the cell to the left of it: `f[i][j] += f[i][j-1]`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n    - After filling in the grid, the value at `f[m-1][n-1]` will be the total number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.\n\n### Example:\n\nConsider a 3x7 grid (m = 3, n = 7):\n\n1. Initialize:\n    ```\n    f = [\n         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ]\n    ```\n\n2. Fill the grid using the state transitions:\n    - First row and first column will be filled directly as there is only one way to traverse them.\n    - For other cells, use the transition rule to sum paths from above and left cells.\n\n3. Final matrix `f` will look like:\n    ```\n    f = [\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n         [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28],\n        ]\n    ```\n\nSo, the number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner is `28`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to solve the problem of finding unique paths in an \\(m \\times n\\) grid using dynamic programming.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:\n        f = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        f[0][0] = 1\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i:\n                    f[i][j] += f[i - 1][j]\n                if j:\n                    f[i][j] += f[i][j - 1]\n        return f[-1][-1]\n", "problem_ids": ["unique-paths"]}, "3203": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a binary string s, and two integers num1 and num2. num1 and num2 are coprime numbers.\nA ratio substring is a substring of s where the ratio between the number of 0's and the number of 1's in the substring is exactly num1 : num2.\n\nFor example, if num1 = 2 and num2 = 3, then \"01011\" and \"1110000111\" are ratio substrings, while \"11000\" is not.\n\nReturn the number of non-empty ratio substrings of s.\nNote that:\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\nTwo values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"0110011\", num1 = 1, num2 = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There exist 4 non-empty ratio substrings.\n- The substring s[0..2]: \"0110011\".

Prefixed Counts:**\n    - We'll use two arrays or variables to keep track of the count of '0's and the count of '1's up to each index `i` in the string `s`.\n    - Let's denote `one[i]` as the number of '1's in the substring `s[0..i]` and `zero[i]` as the number of '0's in the substring `s[0..i]`.\n\n**2. Ratio Condition:**\n    - A substring `s[i+1..j]` should satisfy:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{zero[j] - zero[i]}{one[j] - one[i]} = \\frac{num1}{num2}\n      \\]\n    - Rearranging this, we get:\n      \\[\n      one[j] \\times num1 - zero[j] \\times num2 = one[i] \\times num1 - zero[i] \\times num2\n      \\]\n  \n**3. Using a Hash Table (Dictionary):**\n    - Use a hash table to store and count the occurrences of the value \\( one[i] \\times num1 - zero[i] \\times num2 \\).\n    - Initialize the hash table with an entry `(0, 1)` representing that the empty prefix (before any characters in the string) is counted once.\n\n**4. Traversing the String:**\n    - Iterate through the string character by character.\n    - Update the counts of '0's and '1's.\n    - Calculate the expression \\( one[j] \\times num1 - zero[j] \\times num2 \\) for the current index `j`.\n    - Check how many times this value has occurred before, as this tells how many valid `i`'s exist such that the substring `s[i+1..j]` is a ratio substring.\n    - Add to the total count based on the occurrences found in the hash table.\n    - Update the hash table to include the current value.\n\n**5. Complexity:**\n    - The time complexity is \\( O(n) \\) because we only traverse the string once.\n    - The space complexity is also \\( O(n) \\) due to the storage in the hash table.\n\n#### Summary\n1.

Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "3207": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)\n\nP   A   H   N\nA P L S I I G\nY   I   R\n\nAnd then read line by line: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\nWrite the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:\n\nstring convert(string s, int numRows);\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 3\nOutput: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4\nOutput: \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\nExplanation:\nP     I    N\nA   L S  I G\nY A   H R\nP     I\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"A\", numRows = 1\nOutput: \"A\"\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.\n1 <= numRows <= 1000\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Zigzag Pattern Conversion Problem\n\nTo solve the problem of converting a given string into a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows and then reading it line-by-line to form the final output, follow these detailed steps:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Understand the Zigzag Pattern:**\n   - The zigzag pattern involves writing characters in a diagonal fashion on a set number of rows and then reading the characters row-wise.\n   - For example, with the string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" and 3 rows, the pattern would look like this:\n     ```\n     P   A   H   N\n     A P L S I I G\n     Y   I   R\n     ```\n\n2. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the number of rows is 1, the output is the string itself because there is no zigzag pattern in a single row.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach:**\n   - Represent the zigzag structure using a list of lists (`g`). Each sublist will hold characters that belong to a specific row.\n   - Initialize variables:\n     - `i`: Tracks the current row index.\n     - `k`: A direction indicator (initially set to `-1` to represent upward movement).\n   - Traverse the string character by character. Append each character to the appropriate row in `g` based on the current value of `i`.\n\n4. **Direction Control:**\n   - Adjust the value of `i` and `k` to simulate the zigzag movement:\n     - If you are at the top row (`i == 0`) or the bottom row (`i == numRows - 1`), reverse the direction (`k = -k`).\n     - Update `i` by adding `k` (move up or down accordingly).\n\n5. **Collect the Result:**\n   - Once all characters have been added to the appropriate rows, concatenate all rows to form the final string by joining all sublists in `g`.\n\n#### Detailed Steps for Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a list of `numRows` empty lists (`g`).\n   - Set `i` to `0` (starting at the first row).\n   - Set `k` to `-1` (initial direction is upward).\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String:**\n   - For each character in the string:\n     - Append the character to the current row (`g[i]`).\n     - If you are at the first row (`i == 0`) or the last row (`i == numRows - 1`), multiply `k` by `-1` to change direction.\n     - Increment or decrement `i` by `k` to move to the next row accordingly.\n\n3. **Concatenate Rows:**\n   - After all characters are processed, each sublist in `g` contains the characters of a zigzag row.\n   - Combine all sublists into a single string and return this as the result.\n\n### Example to Clarify the Process\n\nLet's take an example to clarify:\n\n**Input:** `s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4`\n\n1. **Pattern Formation:**\n\n   ```\n   P     I    N\n   A   L S  I G\n   Y A   H R\n   P     I\n   ```\n\n2. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Initialize `g` with 4 empty lists.\n   - Traverse the string and distribute characters according to the zigzag pattern:\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 0.\n     - Traverse \"A\", add to row 1.\n     - Traverse \"Y\", add to row 2.\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 3 (Reverse direction here).\n     - Continue following the described rules.\n\n3. **Result Compilation:**\n   - After processing all characters, concatenate the rows:\n     ```\n     P + I + N + A + L + S + I + G + Y + A + H + R + P + I  => \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\n     ```\n   - Return the concatenated string as the final output.\n\n### Summary\nBy systematically simulating the zigzag pattern, updating row indices, and reversing direction at appropriate points, you can effectively convert the given string to the required format and compile the final output. This approach handles edge cases and ensures an efficient solution.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:\n        if numRows == 1:\n            return s\n        g = [[] for _ in range(numRows)]\n        i, k = 0, -1\n        for c in s:\n            g[i].append(c)\n            if i == 0 or i == numRows - 1:\n                k = -k\n            i += k\n        return ''.join(chain(*g))\n", "problem_ids": ["zigzag-conversion"]}, "3209": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are at a fruit market with different types of exotic fruits on display.\nYou are given a 1-indexed array prices, where prices[i] denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the ith fruit.\nThe fruit market has the following offer:\n\nIf you purchase the ith fruit at prices[i] coins, you can get the next i fruits for free.\n\nNote that even if you can take fruit j for free, you can still purchase it for prices[j] coins to receive a new offer.\nReturn the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [3,1,2]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You can acquire the fruits as follows:\n- Purchase the 1st fruit with 3 coins, and you are allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free.\n- Purchase the 2nd fruit with 1 coin, and you are allowed to take the 3rd fruit for free.\n- Take the 3rd fruit for free.\nNote that even though you were allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free, you purchased it because it is more optimal.\nIt can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [1,10,1,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can acquire the fruits as follows:\n- Purchase the 1st fruit with 1 coin, and you are allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free.\n- Take the 2nd fruit for free.\n- Purchase the 3rd fruit for 1 coin, and you are allowed to take the 4th fruit for free.\n- Take the 4th fruit for free.\nIt can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= prices.length <= 105\n1 <= prices[i] <= 105\n\n Solution: \nSure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Minimum Coins Problem\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nYou are given an array `prices` where each element represents the number of coins needed to buy a fruit. If you buy the `i-th` fruit, you get the next `i` fruits for free. You need to determine the minimum number of coins needed to buy all the fruits.\n\n#### Approach:\nWe use a dynamic programming approach combined with a monotonic queue to keep track of the minimum coins required efficiently.\n\n#### Dynamic Programming Insight:\n1. **Define the State**:\n   - Let `f[i]` represent the minimum number of coins needed to buy all the fruits starting from the `i-th` fruit.\n\n2. **State Transition**:\n   - The critical insight here is that if you buy the `i-th` fruit, all fruits from `i` to `i + i` are free.\n   - The transition equation is:\n     \\[\n     f[i] = \\min_{i + 1 \\le j \\le 2i + 1} f[j] + prices[i - 1]\n     \\]\n   - You need to find the minimum of `f[j]` for `j` ranging from `i + 1` to `2i + 1` and add it to `prices[i - 1]`.\n\n3. **Optimization Using Monotonic Queue**:\n   - To optimize finding the minimum of a range of values `f[j]`, use a monotonic queue that keeps the indices of the minimum values in a sliding window.\n\n#### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Initialize a deque**:\n   - Use a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of indices of `f` values in a monotonically increasing order.\n   \n2. **Traverse the `prices` array from back to front**:\n   - This helps in using the results of subsequent fruits to compute the result of the current fruit.\n\n3. **Update and Maintain the Monotonic Queue**:\n   - For each fruit `i` from the end to the start:\n     - Remove indices from the front of the queue if they are outside the valid range `(i * 2 + 1)`.\n     - If you are in the relevant range, update the `prices[i - 1]` by adding the minimum number of coins found in the queue.\n     - Maintain the monotonic property by removing elements from the rear of the queue that are larger or equal to `prices[i - 1]`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - The final value in `prices[0]` after the loop represents the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all fruits starting from the first fruit.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\nConsider the example `prices = [1, 10, 1, 1]`:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create an empty deque.\n   - Traverse the array from the last index toward the first.\n\n2. **Dequeue Operations and State Updates**:\n   - For each index `i`, manage the queue and update the state `prices[i - 1]` based on the dynamic programming transition.\n\n3. **Queue Maintenance**:\n   - Ensure that the queue only keeps useful indices and maintains an increasing order of values for efficient minimum retrieval.\n\n#### Final Notes:\n- The key insight is to use a dynamic programming approach combined with a monotonic queue to efficiently find the minimum within a sliding window range.\n- Understanding the interplay between the transition equation and the monotonic queue will help in correctly implementing the solution.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the underlying logic, you should be able to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins needed to purchase all the fruits in the given scenario.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(prices)\n        q = deque()\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            while q and q[0] > i * 2 + 1:\n                q.popleft()\n            if i <= (n - 1) // 2:\n                prices[i - 1] += prices[q[0] - 1]\n            while q and prices[q[-1] - 1] >= prices[i - 1]:\n                q.pop()\n            q.append(i)\n        return prices[0]\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-number-of-coins-for-fruits-ii"]}, "3210": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a binary string s, and two integers num1 and num2. num1 and num2 are coprime numbers.\nA ratio substring is a substring of s where the ratio between the number of 0's and the number of 1's in the substring is exactly num1 : num2.\n\nFor example, if num1 = 2 and num2 = 3, then \"01011\" and \"1110000111\" are ratio substrings, while \"11000\" is not.\n\nReturn the number of non-empty ratio substrings of s.\nNote that:\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\nTwo values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"0110011\", num1 = 1, num2 = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There exist 4 non-empty ratio substrings.\n- The substring s[0..2]: \"0110011\".

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you understand and solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n    - You have a list of heights which represent the elevation map where each index corresponds to the height of the bar at that position.\n    - Your task is to determine how much rainwater can be trapped between these bars after raining.\n\n2. **Conceptualize the Solution**:\n    - To solve this problem, you need to know how much water can be trapped above each bar.\n    - For each bar at position `i`, the amount of water trapped above it is determined by the shortest bar on its left and right minus the height at position `i`.\n\n3. **Define Necessary Variables**:\n    - Two arrays: `left` and `right` will be needed\u2014`left[i]` indicating the maximum height to the left of and including the bar at index `i`, and `right[i]` indicating the maximum height to the right of and including the bar at index `i`.\n\n4. **Determine `left` Array**:\n    - Initialize `left[0]` to be the height of the first bar since there's nothing to its left.\n    - For each subsequent bar, the value at `left[i]` will be the maximum of the height at `i` or `left[i-1]`. This ensures that you\u2019re always considering the tallest bar from the left up to index `i`.\n\n5. **Determine `right` Array**:\n    - Initialize `right[n-1]` to be the height of the last bar since there's nothing to its right.\n    - For each previous bar, the value at `right[i]` will be the maximum of the height at `i` or `right[i+1]`. This ensures that you\u2019re always considering the tallest bar from the right up to index `i`.\n\n6. **Calculate Trapped Water**:\n    - For each bar at index `i`, the water that can be trapped is calculated as the minimum of `left[i]` and `right[i]` minus the height of the bar at that position.\n    - Sum up these values for all bars to get the total amount of trapped rainwater.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Arrays**:\n    - Create two arrays `left` and `right` of the same length as the input list `height`.\n\n2. **Fill the Left Array**:\n    - Set `left[0]` to `height[0]`.\n    - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, update `left[i]` as: \n      ```python\n      left[i] = max(left[i - 1], height[i])\n      ```\n\n3. **Fill the Right Array**:\n    - Set `right[n-1]` to `height[n-1]`.\n    - For each index `i` from `n-2` to 0, update `right[i]` as:\n      ```python\n      right[i] = max(right[i + 1], height[i])\n      ```\n\n4. **Compute Total Water Trapped**:\n    - Initialize a variable `trapped_water` to 0.\n    - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, add to `trapped_water`:\n      ```python\n      trapped_water += min(left[i], right[i]) - height[i]\n      ```\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n    - The variable `trapped_water` now contains the total amount of water trapped.\n\n#### Example\n\nFor the list `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`:\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - `left` array becomes `[0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]`\n  - `right` array becomes `[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1]`\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Calculate water trapped at each index:\n    - For index 1, `min(1,3) - 1 = 0`\n    - For index 2, `min(1,3) - 0 = 1`\n    - and so on...\n  - Sum the trapped water for all indices to get the result: `6`.\n\nBy following this guide, you will be able to compute the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the bars after raining for any given list of heights.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(height)\n        left = [height[0]] * n\n        right = [height[-1]] * n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            left[i] = max(left[i - 1], height[i])\n            right[n - i - 1] = max(right[n - i], height[n - i - 1])\n        return sum(min(l, r) - h for l, r, h in zip(left, right, height))\n", "problem_ids": ["trapping-rain-water"]}, "3212": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k.\nA subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k.\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array nums.\nA subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2. Initiate the counter and subset count.\n3. Call the `dfs(0)` to start from the first element.\n4. Return the final count of beautiful subsets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution to find all beautiful subsets of the given array.

The bitwise OR operation between two numbers yields another number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. For example:\n\n- 3 OR 1 = 3 (binary: 11 OR 01 = 11)\n\n#### Step 2: Problem Breakdown\n\nYou need to find the smallest subarray starting at each index `i`, such that the bitwise OR of this subarray is maximal compared to any subarray starting at the same index `i`. Given the maximum value in the subarray for each bit position helps compute the shortest subarray efficiently.\n\n#### Step 3: Traverse the Array in Reverse\n\nReverse traversal is useful because it allows us to store and update the latest positions where each bit was seen effectively as we go from the end of the array to the beginning.\n\n#### Step 4: Maintain an Array for Bit Positions\n\nCreate an array `f` to store the latest indices at which each bit position (from 0 to 31, since any integer fits within 32 bits) was seen as 1. Initialize this array with -1 to signify that no bit has been seen initially.\n\n#### Step 5: Process Each Element from End to Start\n\n- For each element in the array (starting from the end):\n  - Initialize a variable `t` to 1. This will store the length of the smallest subarray starting at the current index.\n  - For each bit position from 0 to 31:\n    - Check if the bit at position `j` in the current element (nums[i]) is set (i.e., equal to 1).\n    - If it is set, update the corresponding entry in array `f` to the current index `i`.\n    - If the bit is not set but `f[j]` is not -1 (meaning this bit has been seen set in some later element), calculate the distance `f[j] - i + 1` and potentially update `t`.\n  - Store `t` in the result array `ans` at the current index `i`.\n\n#### Step 6: Final Output\n\nYour final output will be the array `ans`, where each element represents the length of the smallest subarray starting at that index with the maximum possible bitwise OR.\n\n### Detailed Example:\n\nLet's go over an example using the array `[1, 0, 2, 1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `nums = [1, 0, 2, 1, 3]`\n   - `n = 5`\n   - `ans = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (initially, assume the smallest subarray is of length 1)\n   - `f = [-1, -1, -1, ..., -1]` (32 elements all initialized to -1)\n\n2. **Processing the Elements Reverse:**\n   - For `i = 4` (nums[4] = 3):\n     - Bits of `3` are `...0011` (last two bits are set)\n     - Update `f` for bits 0 and 1 to 4: `f[0] = 4`, `f[1] = 4`\n     - `ans[4] = 1`\n   - For `i = 3` (nums[3] = 1):\n     - Bits of `1` are `...0001` (only the last bit is set)\n     - Update `f` for bit 0 to 3: `f[0] = 3`\n     - Since `f[1] = 4`, calculate potential subarray length for bit 1: `4 - 3 + 1 = 2`\n     - `ans[3] = 2`\n   - And so on for the remaining elements...\n\n3. **Complete the Array:**\n   - Continue this process until the start of the array, updating `ans` accordingly.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - After processing all elements, `ans` will contain the desired lengths for the smallest subarrays with maximum bitwise OR starting at each index.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you'll be able to solve the problem and understand the necessary concepts without directly looking at the code implementation.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def smallestSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        ans = [1] * n\n        f = [-1] * 32\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            t = 1\n            for j in range(32):\n                if (nums[i] >> j) & 1:\n                    f[j] = i\n                elif f[j] != -1:\n                    t = max(t, f[j] - i + 1)\n            ans[i] = t\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["smallest-subarrays-with-maximum-bitwise-or"]}, "3219": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThere are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Here's a detailed guide for a student attempting to solve the problem:\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Problem\n\n**Problem Understanding:**\n\nYou have a social group with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are provided with a list of logs, where each log is represented by `[timestamp, person1, person2]`. This log means that at the given timestamp, `person1` and `person2` become friends. Friendships are mutual, and being acquainted is transitive. Your task is to find the earliest time when everyone in the social group becomes acquainted with every other person. If it's impossible for everyone to become acquainted, return `-1`.\n\n**Approach:**\n\nWe will use a data structure called Union-Find (also known as Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to keep track of connected components (friend circles). By processing logs in increasing order of timestamps, we will unite different sets of friends until we find that all individuals are part of a single set (indicating that everyone is acquainted with everyone else).\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. **Sort the Logs by Timestamp:**\n   - The first step is to sort the logs based on their timestamps in ascending order. This ensures we process the friendships in the order they occur.\n\n2. **Initialize Union-Find Structure:**\n   - Create an array where each element represents a person and points to itself, indicating that initially, each person is their own friend circle.\n   - This array will help to keep track of the parent (or representative) of each person's set.\n\n3. **Union-Find Operations:**\n   - **Find Operation:** This function helps to find the root representative of a person's set. If a person is not their own representative, we recursively find their representative and perform path compression for optimization.\n   - **Union Operation:** This function unites two sets. If two persons belong to different sets, we link one set's representative to the other, effectively merging the sets.\n\n4. **Process Each Log:**\n   - For each sorted log, we check the representatives (root) of the two people involved.\n   - If they are already in the same set, skip to the next log.\n   - If they are not in the same set, we perform the union operation to merge their sets and decrement the count of distinct sets.\n   - After each union, check if the count of distinct sets is `1`, which means everyone is now in a single set.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - If we find that all n people are in the same set at some timestamp, return this timestamp as the result.\n   - If after processing all logs we never reach a single set for all people, return `-1`.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's walk through an example to see how this approach works:\n\n#### Example:\n\nInput:\nLogs: `[[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]]`\nn: `6`\n\n1. **Sort Logs by Timestamp:**\n   Sorted logs: `[[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]]`\n\n2. **Initialize Union-Find Array:**\n   Initial array (let's call it `parent`): `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n\n3. **Processing Logs:**\n   - `20190101` -> Union(0, 1): `parent` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - `20190104` -> Union(3, 4): `parent` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5]`\n   - `20190107` -> Union(2, 3): `parent` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 5]` -> compress path `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 5]`\n   - `20190211` -> Union(1, 5): `parent` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]`\n   - `20190224` -> Union(2, 4): already in the same set, skip.\n   - `20190301` -> Union(0, 3): `parent` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]` -> compress path `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n4. **Check for One Set:**\n   - After processing the log at timestamp `20190301`, we see that all persons are in the same set (all elements point to the same root).\n\n5. **Return Result:**\n   - The earliest time when everyone is acquainted is timestamp `20190301`.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to determine the earliest timestamp when everyone in the social group becomes acquainted with each other.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to re-read any sections if any details are unclear or if you need a refresher at any point while implementing the solution.

Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "3221": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.\n\nFor example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.\n\nGiven an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.\u00a0\nNote: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.\nAn array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [3] has an XOR total of 3.\n- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.\n0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,1,6]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [5] has an XOR total of 5.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [6] has an XOR total of 6.\n- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.\n- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.\n- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.\n- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.\n0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]\nOutput: 480\nExplanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 12\n1 <= nums[i] <= 20\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through how to solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe need to compute the sum of all XOR totals for every possible subset of a given array `nums`. XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares each bit of its operands. For instance, the XOR of 2 (0010 in binary) and 5 (0101 in binary) is 7 (0111 in binary).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Represent Subsets Using Binary Numbers\n- Each subset of an array can be represented by a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included in the subset (1) or not (0).\n- For example, an array `[a, b, c]` has its subsets represented by:\n  - `000` (empty subset)\n  - `001` (subset with only `c`)\n  - `010` (subset with only `b`)\n  - `011` (subset with `b` and `c`)\n  - and so on.\n\n#### 2. Enumerate All Subsets\n- You can enumerate all subsets by considering all binary numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. In binary form, each number in this range corresponds to a subset.\n\n#### 3. Calculate XOR for Each Subset\n- For each subset represented by binary number `i`, check each bit position. Include the element in the subset if the bit is `1`.\n- Compute the XOR for all included elements.\n\n#### 4. Sum All XOR Results\n- Maintain a running total of the XOR results from all subsets. \n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Create a variable to store the total sum of all XOR results.\n\n2. **Loop Through All Possible Subsets:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through all integers from `0` to `2^n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Each Element:**\n   - For each subset, check each bit of the current integer:\n     - If the bit at position `j` is `1`, include the `j`-th element of `nums` in the subset.\n\n4. **Compute XOR for the Current Subset:**\n   - Initialize a variable for the current XOR total. For each `1` bit found, XOR it with the current total.\n\n5. **Add the XOR Result to Total:**\n   - After computing the XOR for the current subset, add it to the running total.\n\n6. **Return the Total Sum:**\n   - Once all subsets are processed, return the running total.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's say the array is `[1, 3]`.\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `total_sum = 0`\n\n2. **Generate Subsets:**\n   - The length `n = 2`, so iterate over `i` from `0` to `3` (`2^2 - 1`).\n\n3. **Subset by `i = 0` (`00` in binary):**\n   - No elements included. XOR total = `0`.\n   - Add `0` to `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Subset by `i = 1` (`01` in binary):**\n   - Include element `1`. XOR total = `1`.\n   - Add `1` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 1`.\n\n5. **Subset by `i = 2` (`10` in binary):**\n   - Include element `3`. XOR total = `3`.\n   - Add `3` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 4`.\n\n6. **Subset by `i = 3` (`11` in binary):**\n   - Include elements `1` and `3`. XOR total = `1 XOR 3 = 2`.\n   - Add `2` to `total_sum`. Now `total_sum = 6`.\n\nFinal output is `6`, as the sum of all XOR totals for every subset is `6`.\n\nUsing this structured approach will help you understand and solve the problem efficiently.

Here\u2019s a detailed guide to help you solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', and a non-negative integer `k`. You need to determine the minimum number of minutes required to take at least `k` of each character ('a', 'b', and 'c') from either the leftmost or the rightmost end of the string. If it's not possible to take `k` of each character, you should return `-1`.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - Input: s = \"aabaaaacaabc\", k = 2\n   - You can approach from both ends of the string to take characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n   - One possible way: \n     - Take three characters from the left (\"aab\"). You have two 'a' characters and one 'b'.\n     - Take five characters from the right (\"caabc\"). You get additional two 'a', one 'b', and two 'c'.\n     - Total time: 3 + 5 = 8 minutes\n   - Output: 8\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - Input: s = \"a\", k = 1\n   - Not possible to have at least one 'b' or 'c'.\n   - Output: -1\n\n### Plan and Approach\n\n1. **Initial Check**: \n   - First, count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string `s`. If any of these characters appear less than `k` times, you can directly return `-1` because it's impossible to collect `k` of each character.\n\n2. **Reverse Problem**:\n   - Think of the problem in reverse: instead of trying to keep characters from both ends, think about removing a substring in the middle. The characters remaining on the sides should still have at least `k` of each 'a', 'b', and 'c'. \n\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - Maintain a sliding window to represent the substring you are \"removing\" from the middle.\n   - Use two pointers, `j` (left boundary) and `i` (right boundary) of the window, initialized to 0.\n   - As you expand the window by moving `i`, decrement the count of the character `s[i]` from the total count.\n\n4. **Window Adjustment**:\n   - If the count of the character being decremented (due to expanding the window) drops below `k`, increment `j` to shrink the window from the left until all characters outside the window have at least `k` count.\n\n5. **Track Maximum Window Size**:\n   - Keep track of the maximum size of the window you can maintain while each character outside the window still has at least `k` counts.\n   - The number of minutes required will be the length of the entire string minus the maximum size of the window.\n\n### Pseudocode Outline\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each character in `s`.\n2. If any character count is less than `k`, return `-1`.\n3. Initialize variables: `mx = 0`, `j = 0`, and a sliding window over the string with the right boundary `i`.\n4. For each character at position `i` in the string:\n   - Decrement the count of this character.\n   - If count of any character drops below `k`, move `j` to the right until the count is restored to at least `k`.\n   - Update `mx` with the current maximum window size.\n5. Return the result as the length of the string minus `mx`.\n\n### Final Thought\n\n- Consider edge cases such as strings with minimum length, `k` being zero, which should immediately imply that no characters need to be taken, or strings significantly longer than `k`.\n\nBy understanding and applying these steps, you should be able to solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def takeCharacters(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        cnt = Counter(s)\n        if any(cnt[c] < k for c in \"abc\"):\n            return -1\n        mx = j = 0\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            cnt[c] -= 1\n            while cnt[c] < k:\n                cnt[s[j]] += 1\n                j += 1\n            mx = max(mx, i - j + 1)\n        return len(s) - mx\n", "problem_ids": ["take-k-of-each-character-from-left-and-right"]}, "3224": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k.\nA subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k.\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array nums.\nA subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2.

Let's break down the problem and our approach to solving it step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou have an integer array `nums` and you need to find the \"beauty\" of each subarray of a given size `k`. The beauty of a subarray is defined as the `x`th smallest negative integer within that subarray. If a subarray has fewer than `x` negative integers, the beauty is `0`.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Use a Sliding Window\n\nThe main technique you will use here is called the \"sliding window\". This means you will continuously move a window of size `k` across the array to examine every contiguous subarray of length `k`.\n\n#### 2. Count Array\n\nGiven the range of integers in `nums` is from `-50` to `50`, you can use an array of fixed size `101` to count the occurrences of each integer. This works because you can shift all values by adding 50 to make them fit within the range `0` to `100`.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. **Initialize Count Array:**\n   - Create an array `cnt` of size `101` to store the count of each number in the range `-50` to `50`. \n   - Initialize all elements of `cnt` to zero.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Window:**\n   - For the first subarray of size `k` in `nums`, update the `cnt` array by incrementing the count at the index corresponding to each number in the subarray (Remember to shift each number by adding 50).\n\n3. **Function to Find xth Smallest Negative:**\n   - Write a helper function that scans through the `cnt` array to find the `x`th smallest negative number. This can be done by traversing through the first `50` elements of `cnt` (which corresponds to numbers from `-50` to `-1` after shifting).\n\n4. **Sliding the Window:**\n   - Start sliding the window from the beginning of the array to the end:\n     - For each new iteration, add the next number coming into the window to the `cnt` array.\n     - Remove the number that is sliding out of the window from the `cnt` array.\n     - Use the helper function to determine the beauty value for the current window and store it in the result list.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - Once you have slid the window across the entire array, return the list of beauty values.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's go through an example to clarify the process:\n\n**Example:**\nInput: `nums = [1, -1, -3, -2, 3]`, `k = 3`, `x = 2`\n\n1. **Initialize `cnt`:**\n   - `cnt` is an array of size `101` all set to `0`.\n\n2. **First Window `[1, -1, -3]`:**\n   - Convert to indices: `[1+50, -1+50, -3+50]` => `[51, 49, 47]`.\n   - Update `cnt`: `cnt[51] = 1`, `cnt[49] = 1`, `cnt[47] = 1`.\n\n3. **Calculate Beauty for First Window:**\n   - Traverse first `50` elements in `cnt` to find the 2nd smallest negative integer.\n   - 2nd smallest negative: `-1`.\n\n4. **Move Window to Next Position `[ -1, -3, -2 ]`:**\n   - Add `-2+50` => `48` to `cnt`.\n   - Remove `1+50` => `51` from `cnt`.\n   - Update `cnt`: `cnt[49] = 1`, `cnt[47] = 1`, `cnt[48] = 1`, `cnt[51] = 0`.\n\n5. **Calculate Beauty for Second Window:**\n   - Traverse `cnt` again.\n   - 2nd smallest negative: `-2`.\n\n6. **Continue Sliding the Window:**\n   - Follow the same steps, move to next window `[ -3, -2, 3 ]`.\n   - Update counts and find the 2nd smallest negative integer for each window position until the end of the array.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to find the beauty values for every subarray of size `k` within the array. This approach ensures you efficiently manage the counting and determination using the sliding window technique and a count array to keep track of number occurrences. This method is efficient and works well within the given problem constraints.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def getSubarrayBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        def f(x: int) -> int:\n            s = 0\n            for i in range(50):\n                s += cnt[i]\n                if s >= x:\n                    return i - 50\n            return 0\n\n        cnt = [0] * 101\n        for v in nums[:k]:\n            cnt[v + 50] += 1\n        ans = [f(x)]\n        for i in range(k, len(nums)):\n            cnt[nums[i] + 50] += 1\n            cnt[nums[i - k] + 50] -= 1\n            ans.append(f(x))\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["sliding-subarray-beauty"]}, "3226": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer n.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you solve the given coding problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Room Allocation Problem\n\n#### 1. Understand the Problem:\nYou have `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n-1` and a list of meetings. Each meeting has an original start time, and you need to allocate rooms in such a way that minimizes delays. If all rooms are occupied, meetings should be delayed but keep their duration. You need to determine which room hosts the most meetings, and in case of a tie, return the room with the smallest number.\n\n#### 2. Data Structures to Use:\n- **Min-Heaps (Priority Queues)**:\n  - **Idle Rooms Min-Heap**: Stores idle rooms by their index, ensuring you can quickly get the room with the lowest number.\n  - **Busy Rooms Min-Heap**: Stores busy rooms by their end times and room indexes, allowing you to efficiently find the room that's going to be free the soonest.\n\n- **Counts Array**: An array to keep track of how many meetings each room hosts.\n\n#### 3. Sort Meetings:\nSort the meetings array based on start times to process them in chronological order.\n\n#### 4. Process Each Meeting:\nFor each meeting:\n- **Freeing Up Rooms**: Check the busy rooms heap. If the meeting with the earliest end time is completed (i.e., its end time is less than or equal to the current meeting's start time), move those rooms back to the idle rooms heap.\n- **Allocating Rooms**:\n  - **If Idle Rooms Available**: Pop the smallest indexed room from the idle rooms heap and mark it as busy until the end of the current meeting.\n  - **If No Idle Rooms Available**: Pop the room from the busy heap that will be free the soonest, delay the start of this meeting to align with the end time of this room's current meeting, then push it back into the busy heap with the new end time.\n\n#### 5. Track Meetings Count:\nEvery time a room gets a meeting allocated, increment its count in the counts array.\n\n#### 6. Determine the Result:\nAfter processing all meetings, iterate over the counts array to find the room with the highest count. If there is a tie, pick the room with the smallest number.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Initialize Heaps**:\n   - Create an empty list for busy rooms.\n   - Create a list of idle rooms initialized with room indexes from `0` to `n-1` and convert it to a heap.\n   - Create a counts array of size `n` initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **Sort the Meetings**:\n   - Sort the meetings list based on start times.\n\n3. **Process Each Meeting**:\n   - For each meeting `[start, end]`:\n     - Move rooms from the busy heap to the idle heap if their end time is less than or equal to the current meeting's start time.\n     - If there are idle rooms:\n       - Pop the smallest room index from the idle heap, increment its meeting count, and push it to the busy heap with its end time.\n     - If there are no idle rooms:\n       - Pop the room that will be free the soonest from the busy heap, delay the meeting, increment its count, and push it back to the busy heap with the new end time.\n\n4. **Determine the Room with Most Meetings**:\n   - Initialize a variable to store the index of the room with the maximum meetings.\n   - Iterate through the counts array to find the index with the maximum value.\n   - Return this index.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to determine which room has hosted the most meetings while handling delays and room allocation efficiently using heaps.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        meetings.sort()\n        busy = []\n        idle = list(range(n))\n        heapify(idle)\n        cnt = [0] * n\n        for s, e in meetings:\n            while busy and busy[0][0] <= s:\n                heappush(idle, heappop(busy)[1])\n            if idle:\n                i = heappop(idle)\n                cnt[i] += 1\n                heappush(busy, (e, i))\n            else:\n                a, i = heappop(busy)\n                cnt[i] += 1\n                heappush(busy, (a + e - s, i))\n        ans = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(cnt):\n            if cnt[ans] < v:\n                ans = i\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["meeting-rooms-iii"]}, "3227": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a m x n 0-indexed 2D matrix mat.

Your task is to create numbers by traveling through the matrix in eight possible directions: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east. Each number is created by appending digits as you move in a chosen direction.\n\nFor example, if you start at cell \\((0, 0)\\) and move east, and the digits in the cells you visit are 1, 1, 1, the numbers you generate at each step will be 1, 11, 111.\n\nYour objective is to:\n\n1. Find all numbers created by moving from every cell in each of the eight directions.\n2. Identify which of these numbers are prime numbers greater than 10.\n3. Determine the prime number that appears most frequently. If there are multiple prime numbers with the same highest frequency, choose the largest one.\n4. If no such prime number exists, return -1.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Set up a counter to keep track of the frequency of each prime number greater than 10 that you find.\n\n2. **Define a Function to Check for Prime Numbers:**\n   - Write a helper function to check if a number is prime. Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1, which has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Each Cell in the Matrix:**\n   - For each cell in the matrix, consider it as the starting point and generate numbers by moving in each of the eight possible directions.\n\n4. **Generate Numbers by Moving in Each Direction:**\n   - Every time you move to a new cell, append its digit to the current number being formed.\n   - After forming a new number, check if it is a prime number greater than 10.\n   - If the number meets the criteria, update its frequency in your counter.\n\n5. **Track the Most Frequent Prime Number:**\n   - Once you've generated and checked all possible numbers, go through your counter to find the prime number with the highest frequency.\n   - If there are ties (multiple numbers with the same highest frequency), pick the largest prime number among them.\n\n6. **Return the Result:**\n   - If you find at least one prime number greater than 10, return the one which meets the requirements from the previous step.\n   - If no such prime number exists, return -1.\n\n#### Detailed Implementation Strategy:\n\n1. **Helper Function for Prime Check:**\n   - Use an efficient method to check for prime numbers due to the boundary constraints, such as iterating up to the square root of the number.\n\n2. **Directional Movements:**\n   - Define your 8 possible movements as pairs of coordinates. For example, east movement might be defined as (0, 1), south-east as (1, 1), and so on.\n\n3. **Number Generation:**\n   - Start from each cell and continue appending digits as you move in a specified direction until you go out of the matrix bounds.\n   - Convert the sequence of digits into a number.\n\n4. **Prime Validation:**\n   - After forming each number, check if it is a prime and greater than 10. If it is, add it to your counter.\n\n5. **Final Analysis:**\n   - After processing the entire matrix, analyze your counter to determine the most frequent and largest prime number.\n\nThis strategy ensures that all potential numbers are considered and primes greater than 10 are properly identified and counted. The final step picks the optimal prime based on frequency and value criteria.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def mostFrequentPrime(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        def is_prime(x: int) -> int:\n            return all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, isqrt(x) + 1))\n\n        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])\n        cnt = Counter()\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                for a in range(-1, 2):\n                    for b in range(-1, 2):\n                        if a == 0 and b == 0:\n                            continue\n                        x, y, v = i + a, j + b, mat[i][j]\n                        while 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n:\n                            v = v * 10 + mat[x][y]\n                            if is_prime(v):\n                                cnt[v] += 1\n                            x, y = x + a, y + b\n        ans, mx = -1, 0\n        for v, x in cnt.items():\n            if mx < x:\n                mx = x\n                ans = v\n            elif mx == x:\n                ans = max(ans, v)\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["most-frequent-prime"]}, "3228": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer value.\nIn one operation, you can add or subtract value from any element of nums.\n\nFor example, if nums = [1,2,3] and value = 2, you can choose to subtract value from nums[0] to make nums = [-1,2,3].\n\nThe MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing non-negative integer in it.\n\nFor example, the MEX of [-1,2,3] is 0 while the MEX of [1,0,3] is 2.\n\nReturn the maximum MEX of nums after applying the mentioned operation any number of times.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,-10,7,13,6,8], value = 5\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: One can achieve this result by applying the following operations:\n- Add value to nums[1] twice to make nums = [1,0,7,13,6,8]\n- Subtract value from nums[2] once to make nums = [1,0,2,13,6,8]\n- Subtract value from nums[3] twice to make nums = [1,0,2,3,6,8]\nThe MEX of nums is 4.

Here\u2019s a detailed step-by-step guide to help a student solve the problem without revealing the actual code snippets:\n\n---\n\n### Finding the Maximum MEX after Array Operations\n\n**Objective:**\n\nGiven an integer array `nums` and an integer `value`, your task is to determine the maximum MEX (minimum excluded value) we can achieve after performing any number of operations where you can either add or subtract `value` from any element in `nums` an unlimited number of times.\n\n### Important Concepts:\n\n1. **MEX (Minimum Excluded Value):** This is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.\n2. **Operations:** You can add or subtract `value` from any element in the array.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - You have an array of integers `nums`.\n   - You can repeatedly add or subtract a given integer `value` to/from any element in the array.\n   - You want to determine the highest possible MEX after performing any number of these operations.\n\n2. **Using Remainders:**\n   - Realize that adding or subtracting `value` to/from an element affects its remainder when divided by `value`. Hence, the state of each element modulo `value` is crucial.\n   - For a clearer understanding, divide each element by `value` and consider the remainder.\n\n3. **Count Remainders:**\n   - Create a counting structure (like a hash map or a frequency array) to keep track of how many elements have each possible remainder when divided by `value`.\n\n4. **Simulate Finding the MEX:**\n   - Start checking from `0` upwards to determine the smallest non-negative integer (MEX) that cannot be formed.\n   - For each integer `i`, check if there are sufficient elements with the remainder `i % value`.\n     - If for any `i`, the remainder `i % value` is not present in the counting structure, this `i` is the MEX.\n\n5. **Update the Counter:**\n   - As you check each integer `i`, if the remainder `i % value` is present, decrement the count for that remainder, since you are attempting to \"use\" one instance of an element that produces this remainder.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Counter:**\n   - Create a counter for remainders when elements of `nums` are divided by `value`.\n\n2. **Fill the Counter:**\n   - Traverse through `nums` and for each element, compute its remainder when divided by `value` and increment the corresponding count in the counter.\n\n3. **Determine the MEX:**\n   - Start from `0` and iterate upwards.\n   - For each `i`, calculate `i % value`.\n   - Check if the counter entry for `i % value` is greater than `0`. If not, then `i` is the MEX.\n   - If it is, decrement the counter for `i % value` and move to the next integer.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider `nums = [1, -10, 7, 13, 6, 8]` and `value = 5`.\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Count remainders when divided by `5`.\n\n2. **Counting Remainders:**\n   - Remainders: `1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3` \u2192 Counter: `{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2}`\n\n3. **Finding MEX:**\n   - `i = 0` \u2192 Check `cnt[0 % 5] = 1` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 1` \u2192 Check `cnt[1 % 5] = 2` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 2` \u2192 Check `cnt[2 % 5] = 1` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 3` \u2192 Check `cnt[3 % 5] = 2` \u2192 Decrement it, move to next `i`.\n   - `i = 4` \u2192 `cnt[4 % 5] = 0` \u2192 Not present \u2192 Maximum MEX = `4`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBy counting the occurrences of each remainder and systematically checking each possible integer starting from `0`, you can efficiently determine the MEX after performing any sequence of operations. This approach ensures you can find the maximum possible MEX in an optimal way.\n\nGood luck, and happy coding!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def findSmallestInteger(self, nums: List[int], value: int) -> int:\n        cnt = Counter(x % value for x in nums)\n        for i in range(len(nums) + 1):\n            if cnt[i % value] == 0:\n                return i\n            cnt[i % value] -= 1\n", "problem_ids": ["smallest-missing-non-negative-integer-after-operations"]}, "3229": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nAlice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.\nThere are n stones in a pile.

This guide will outline the thought process step-by-step to help you, as a student, solve this problem on your own.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solving the Problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Mechanics**:\n    - Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` stones.\n    - On each turn, a player removes a stone and receives points based on their value of that stone. Alice and Bob have different valuations for each stone.\n    - The goal is to determine who will win the game, assuming both play optimally.\n\n2. **Evaluate Strategy**:\n    - Both players aim to maximize their own score while minimizing their opponent's score.\n    - Since Alice goes first, she has a slight edge in the game, but Bob will also play optimally.\n\n3. **Create Total Value Array**:\n    - Combine the value each player gives to each stone into a total value array.\n    - This array will help us understand the combined significance of each stone to the two players.\n    - For each stone `i`, create a tuple `(aliceValues[i] + bobValues[i], i)` which includes the total value and the index of the stone.\n\n4. **Sort Stones by Total Value**:\n    - Sort this combined value array in descending order of the total value.\n    - This sorting will ensure that the stone most valuable in total to both players will be considered first.\n\n5. **Simulate the Game**:\n    - Once sorted, let Alice and Bob pick stones alternately from this sorted list.\n    - Alice will pick stones at the even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) in the sorted array.\n    - Bob will pick stones at the odd positions (1, 3, 5, ...) in the sorted array.\n\n6. **Calculate Scores**:\n    - Traverse through the sorted array and sum up the values for Alice and Bob based on their respective value arrays.\n    - Use the indices from the sorted array to fetch the original values from `aliceValues` and `bobValues`.\n\n7. **Compare Scores**:\n    - After all stones are picked, compare the total scores of Alice and Bob.\n    - If Alice has more points than Bob, Alice wins.\n    - If Bob has more points than Alice, Bob wins.\n    - If both have the same score, the game is a draw.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's take an example to see how this strategy works in action.\n\n#### Sample Input:\n- `aliceValues = [1, 3]`\n- `bobValues = [2, 1]`\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Create Combined Values**:\n    - For the given arrays, create combined values: `[(1 + 2, 0), (3 + 1, 1)]` => `[(3, 0), (4, 1)]`\n\n2. **Sort Combined Values**:\n    - After sorting in descending order by the total value, we get: `[(4, 1), (3, 0)]`.\n\n3. **Alternate Picks**:\n    - Alice picks first, so she picks the first stone in the sorted list (index 1 from the original list):\n        - Alice's score: `3`\n    - Bob picks next, he picks the second stone in the sorted list (index 0 from the original list):\n        - Bob's score: `2`\n\n4. **Final Comparison**:\n    - Alice's total score: `3`\n    - Bob's total score: `2`\n    - Since Alice's score is greater than Bob's, Alice wins.\n\nUsing this structured method allows you to tackle the problem in a logical and organized manner. By following these steps, you can solve similar problems where players pick items alternately based on their values. This approach guarantees that you are making optimal decisions at each step and can confidently determine the result of the game.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def stoneGameVI(self, aliceValues: List[int], bobValues: List[int]) -> int:\n        vals = [(a + b, i) for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(aliceValues, bobValues))]\n        vals.sort(reverse=True)\n        a = sum(aliceValues[i] for _, i in vals[::2])\n        b = sum(bobValues[i] for _, i in vals[1::2])\n        if a > b:\n            return 1\n        if a < b:\n            return -1\n        return 0\n", "problem_ids": ["stone-game-vi"]}, "3230": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:\n\n'?'

The input string `s`, containing only lowercase English letters.\n2. The pattern `p`, which can contain lowercase English letters, '?' and '*'.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the pattern `p` matches the entire input string `s`. Here\u2019s how the special characters work in the pattern:\n- `?` matches any single character.\n- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).\n\nFor example:\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"a\"` should return `false` because \"a\" does not match \"aa\".\n- `s = \"aa\", p = \"*\"` should return `true` because '*' can match any sequence, including \"aa\".\n- `s = \"cb\", p = \"?a\"` should return `false` because although '?' matches 'c', 'a' does not match 'b'.\n\n#### Approach to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem effectively, you can use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - Design a function `dfs(i, j)` that will check if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` matches the substring of `p` starting from index `j`.\n   - The result would be stored in a cache to avoid recomputation.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - If `i` (the current position in `s`) is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, the function should return `True` only if `j` (the current position in `p`) is also at or beyond the end of `p`, or if the remaining characters in `p` are all '*'.\n   - If `j` is beyond the length of `p` but `i` isn't, return `False` since pattern `p` lacks more characters to match with `s`.\n\n3. **Handling '*' Character**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '*', check the following possibilities:\n     - The '*' matches zero characters \u2013 move to the next character in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i, j + 1)`).\n     - The '*' matches one or more characters \u2013 move to the next character in `s` but keep the current position in `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j)`) or move to the next character in both `s` and `p` (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n4. **Handling '?' Character or Exact Match**:\n   - If the current character in `p` is '?' or the characters in `s` and `p` match, then move to the next characters in both the strings (i.e., `dfs(i + 1, j + 1)`).\n\n5. **Memoization**:\n   - Use a caching mechanism to store the results of function calls to avoid redundant calculations. This will help in improving the efficiency drastically.\n\n6. **Final Check**:\n   - Begin the recursion from the start of both the strings (i.e., call `dfs(0, 0)`).\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\nYou can summarize the above logic into the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction isMatch(s, p):\n    memo = createEmptyCache()  # Initialize a cache to store results\n\n    Define function dfs(i, j):\n        if i >= length(s):\n            return j >= length(p) OR (p[j] == '*' AND func(i, j + 1))\n        if j >= length(p):\n            return False\n        if p[j] == '*':\n            return dfs(i + 1, j) OR dfs(i + 1, j + 1) OR dfs(i, j + 1)\n        return (p[j] == '?' OR s[i] == p[j]) AND dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n    return dfs(0, 0)\n\nCall isMatch with the strings s and p.\n```\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to construct a solution for the wildcard pattern matching problem by carefully defining and implementing the recursive function `dfs` with memoization. This will ensure you handle all possible pattern matching scenarios efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> bool:\n            if i >= len(s):\n                return j >= len(p) or (p[j] == \"*\" and dfs(i, j + 1))\n            if j >= len(p):\n                return False\n            if p[j] == \"*\":\n                return dfs(i + 1, j) or dfs(i + 1, j + 1) or dfs(i, j + 1)\n            return (p[j] == \"?\" or s[i] == p[j]) and dfs(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n        return dfs(0, 0)\n", "problem_ids": ["wildcard-matching"]}, "3231": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\nThe initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\nIf more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    \nIncrease the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.\n        \nFor example, say you start with the words [\"abcdef\",\"abndef\"] both initially abbreviated as \"a4f\". Then, a sequence of operations would be [\"a4f\",\"a4f\"] -> [\"ab3f\",\"ab3f\"] -> [\"abc2f\",\"abn2f\"].\n\n\nThis operation is repeated until every abbreviation is unique.\n\n\nAt the end, if an abbreviation did not make a word shorter, then keep it as the original word.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = [\"like\",\"god\",\"internal\",\"me\",\"internet\",\"interval\",\"intension\",\"face\",\"intrusion\"]\nOutput: [\"l2e\",\"god\",\"internal\",\"me\",\"i6t\",\"interval\",\"inte4n\",\"f2e\",\"intr4n\"]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: words = [\"aa\",\"aaa\"]\nOutput: [\"aa\",\"aaa\"]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 400\n2 <= words[i].length <= 400\nwords[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of words are unique.\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solve the Minimal Possible Abbreviations Problem\n\nWelcome to the guide for solving the problem of finding minimal possible abbreviations for a list of distinct strings! Follow these steps to understand the problem, approach, and implementation details for crafting a solution.\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\n1. **Basic Abbreviation Rule:** For each word, the initial abbreviation is formed by taking the first character, followed by the number of characters in between, and ending with the last character. For example, the word \"like\" would be abbreviated to \"l2e\".\n\n2. **Conflict Resolution:** If two or more words share the same abbreviation, the abbreviation must be refined by increasing the number of prefix (starting characters) included until all abbreviations are unique.\n\n3. **Original Words:** If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, retain the original word in the output.\n\n#### Key Insights\n\n- **Grouping by Length and Last Character:** Words that share the same first and last characters and have the same length will likely conflict if abbreviated using the initial rule. Therefore, such words should be grouped together.\n\n- **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to manage words within each group. Each node in the Trie will contain an array for its children and a counter to keep track of the number of words passing through that node.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Solution\n\n1. **Grouping Words:**\n   - Group words by their length and last character. Create a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, last_character) and values are tries.\n\n2. **Inserting Words into Tries:**\n   - For each word in your input list, insert it into its respective trie using the grouping criteria. While inserting, increment the count at each Trie node to keep a track of words passing through each node.\n\n3. **Searching Abbreviation Length:**\n   - For finding the minimal unique abbreviation, traverse the Trie for each word. For each character in the word:\n     - If the count of words passing through a node is `1`, you've found a unique abbreviation at that length.\n     - Otherwise, keep traversing deeper into the Trie.\n\n4. **Build Final Abbreviations:**\n   - For each word, based on the computed length from the Trie traversal:\n     - If the abbreviation (including the first and last characters and the middle number) is shorter than the original word, use it.\n     - Otherwise, keep the original word.\n\n#### Practical Constraints\n\n- Ensure you understand the constraints like the maximum length of each word (400) and the total number of words (up to 400).\n\n#### Example and Explanation\n\nConsider the input: `[\"like\", \"god\", \"internal\", \"me\", \"internet\", \"interval\", \"intension\", \"face\", \"intrusion\"]`.\n\n1. **Grouping:**\n   - Group words such that words having the same length and last characters are placed together.\n\n2. **Trie Insertion:**\n   - Insert each word into the respective Trie and maintain count of each Trie node.\n\n3. **Unique Abbreviation Search:**\n   - Traverse through Trie nodes to find the minimal unique prefix for each word.\n\n4. **Finalize Abbreviations:**\n   - Form the abbreviations and compare them in length with the original word to decide which to use:\n     - \"like\" becomes \"l2e\"\n     - \"god\" remains \"god\" (as it is short enough)\n     - Continue this for each word...\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you should be able to construct a solution to generate minimal unique abbreviations for a list of words as described in the problem statement. This approach leverages trie data structures and strategic grouping to efficiently manage and resolve abbreviation conflicts.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Trie:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    def insert(self, w: str):\n        node = self\n        for c in w:\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            if not node.children[idx]:\n                node.children[idx] = Trie()\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            node.cnt += 1\n\n    def search(self, w: str) -> int:\n        node = self\n        cnt = 0\n        for c in w:\n            cnt += 1\n            idx = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n            node = node.children[idx]\n            if node.cnt == 1:\n                return cnt\n        return len(w)\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wordsAbbreviation(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        tries = {}\n        for w in words:\n            m = len(w)\n            if (m, w[-1]) not in tries:\n                tries[(m, w[-1])] = Trie()\n            tries[(m, w[-1])].insert(w)\n        ans = []\n        for w in words:\n            cnt = tries[(len(w), w[-1])].search(w)\n            ans.append(\n                w if cnt + 2 >= len(w) else w[:cnt] + str(len(w) - cnt - 1) + w[-1]\n            )\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["word-abbreviation"]}, "3233": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nWe are given n different types of stickers.

Your goal is to figure out the minimum number of these stickers you need to spell out a given target string by cutting out individual letters from the stickers and rearranging them. Each sticker can be used an infinite number of times.\n\n#### Step 2: Problem Constraints\n1. The number of stickers, \\( n \\), is between 1 and 50.\n2. Each sticker's word length is between 1 and 10 characters.\n3. The target string length is between 1 and 15 characters.\n4. All stickers and the target string consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n#### Step 3: Key Insight - State Representation\nGiven the small length of the target string (max 15 characters), we can represent the state of completion for the target string using a binary number:\n- A bit at position \\( i \\) in the binary number represents whether the \\( i \\)-th character of the target string has been spelled out.\n- If the bit is 1, it means the character at position \\( i \\) has been spelled out.\n- If the bit is 0, it means the character at position \\( i \\) has not been spelled out.\n\n#### Step 4: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS)\nWe'll approach the problem using BFS because it efficiently explores all possible ways to spell the target string to find the minimum number of steps:\n1. **Initial State**: Start with all bits as 0, meaning no characters of the target have been spelled out.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of states to be explored, starting from the initial state (0).\n3. **Visited States**: Use an array to mark visited states to avoid re-exploring them.\n\n#### Step 5: Mapping Stickers to Target Characters\nFor each state, try to use each sticker to spell out more characters of the target string:\n1. Convert the sticker into a frequency count of its characters.\n2. For each unspelled character in the target string, try to spell it using the current sticker.\n3. Update the state accordingly by setting the appropriate bits to 1.\n\n#### Step 6: Transition Between States\nFor every state in our BFS:\n1. Dequeue the current state.\n2. Check if this state corresponds to all bits being 1 (i.e., the target is spelled out completely). If so, return the number of steps (stickers used).\n3. For each sticker, calculate the new state by attempting to use its characters to spell more of the target string.\n4. If the new state hasn\u2019t been visited before, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n\n#### Step 7: Implement BFS Logic\n1. Initialize your queue with the starting state.\n2. Use a loop (while queue is not empty) to explore each state.\n3. For each state, iterate over all stickers to compute possible new states.\n4. Track the number of stickers used in the process.\n5. Return the minimum number of stickers when the target is spelled out (all bits set to 1), or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nThis high-level algorithm should help you understand how to approach the problem and implement a solution using BFS, state compression, and bit manipulation techniques. Remember, the BFS ensures that the first time you reach the final state where the target string can be completely spelled out, you have achieved it using the minimum number of stickers.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minStickers(self, stickers: List[str], target: str) -> int:\n        n = len(target)\n        q = deque([0])\n        vis = [False] * (1 << n)\n        vis[0] = True\n        ans = 0\n        while q:\n            for _ in range(len(q)):\n                cur = q.popleft()\n                if cur == (1 << n) - 1:\n                    return ans\n                for s in stickers:\n                    cnt = Counter(s)\n                    nxt = cur\n                    for i, c in enumerate(target):\n                        if (cur >> i & 1) == 0 and cnt[c] > 0:\n                            cnt[c] -= 1\n                            nxt |= 1 << i\n                    if not vis[nxt]:\n                        vis[nxt] = True\n                        q.append(nxt)\n            ans += 1\n        return -1\n", "problem_ids": ["stickers-to-spell-word"]}, "3234": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an even integer n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.

Here's a guide to help you achieve that:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Setup:**\n   - You are given an even integer \\( n \\).\n   - An initial permutation array \\( perm \\) of size \\( n \\) is constructed where \\( perm[i] = i \\) for all \\( i \\) (0-indexed). For example, if \\( n = 4 \\), \\( perm \\) will initially be \\([0, 1, 2, 3]\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Rules:**\n   - Two rules determine how to construct a new array `arr` from `perm`:\n     - **Even indices:** If \\( i \\) is even, then \\( arr[i] = perm[i / 2] \\).\n     - **Odd indices:** If \\( i \\) is odd, then \\( arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2] \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation:**\n   - To perform one operation, you create a new array `arr` by applying the above rules and then set `perm` to this new array `arr`.\n\n4. **Determine Minimum Operations:**\n   - You need to find the minimum number of operations required to make `perm` equal to its original state.\n   - You can achieve this by tracking the position of a specific element until it returns to its original position.\n   - A key observation is that the \"movement path\" of the numbers is consistent across rounds. Thus, tracking a single number (such as the number at index 1, initially `perm[1] = 1`) will help identify the cycle length. Once this number returns to its original position, the entire array will have returned to the original permutation.\n\n5. **Tracking the Position of `1`:**\n   - Initialize a counter `operations` to zero.\n   - Start from index `1` of `perm`.\n   - Apply the transformation rules repeatedly to determine the new position of `1`.\n   - Continue the process until the number `1` is back at index `1`.\n\n6. **Loop Until Original Position:**\n   - Increment the `operations` counter each time until you find `1` back at index `1`.\n\n### Formulating the Plan:\n\n- **Initialize Variables:** \n  - Set a counter `operations` to zero.\n  - Start with `i = 1` (since the value at index 1 in the initial perm is `1`).\n\n- **Iteration Logic:**\n  - Loop and apply the transformation rules:\n    - If the current index `i` is less than \\( n / 2 \\), move `i` to \\( 2 \\times i \\).\n    - Else, move `i` to \\( (2 \\times (i - n / 2)) + 1 \\).\n  - Increment the `operations` counter after each transformation.\n\n- **Stop Condition:**\n  - The loop terminates once `i` returns to `1`.\n\nBy following this guide, you can manually simulate the process and write a program to automate it. This approach leverages the observed pattern of transformations, specifically tracking the cycle of a single element to determine the full cycle for the permutation return. This ensures an efficient solution without necessitating the entire array simulation repeatedly.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def reinitializePermutation(self, n: int) -> int:\n        ans, i = 0, 1\n        while 1:\n            ans += 1\n            if i < n >> 1:\n                i <<= 1\n            else:\n                i = (i - (n >> 1)) << 1 | 1\n            if i == 1:\n                return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-number-of-operations-to-reinitialize-a-permutation"]}, "3235": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English characters.

Here is a detailed guide to solve the problem of converting the string \"source\" to the string \"target\" with the least cost using a set of allowed transformations:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Inputs**:\n    - `source` and `target`: Two strings of the same length, composed of lowercase English characters.\n    - `original` and `changed`: Arrays of strings where each element in \"original\" denotes a substring (x) that can be changed to the corresponding substring (y) in \"changed\" for a specific cost given in the `cost` array.\n\n2. **Output**:\n    - The minimum cost to convert `source` to `target` using any number of operations where each operation converts `x` to `y` provided in the `original`, `changed`, and `cost` arrays.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n    - Each pair of operations must either be disjoint (non-overlapping indices) or operate on identical indices.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nTo solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**:\n    - Think of each substring transformation (`original[i]` to `changed[i]`) as a directed edge in a graph with an associated cost (`cost[i]`).\n\n2. **Use a Data Structure (Trie)**:\n    - Use a trie to store substrings from `original` and `changed` such that you can efficiently track and convert indices.\n\n3. **Initialize Cost Array `g`**:\n    - Create a 2D array `g` where `g[i][j]` represents the minimum transformation cost from substring `i` to substring `j`.\n\n4. **Fill Costs using Given Transformations**:\n    - Iterate over the transformations in `original`, `changed`, and `cost` arrays, and update `g` such that `g[i][j]` represents the lowest cost to transform `original[i]` to `changed[j]`.\n\n5. **Apply the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:\n    - Efficiently compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph. This step ensures that you find the minimum cost to transform any substring to any other substring.\n\n6. **Define Recursive Conversion Function (DFS)**:\n    - Create a recursive function `dfs(i)` that computes the minimum cost to convert `source[i..]` to `target[i..]`. Use memoization to store results of already computed subproblems.\n    - The function checks:\n        - If `source[i]` equals `target[i]`, simply move to the next character.\n        - Otherwise, try all possible substring transformations from `i` to `j` and keep track of the minimum cost.\n\n7. **Combine Results and Determine the Final Cost**:\n    - Convert the full `source` to `target` starting from index 0 using `dfs(0)`. If the conversion cost exceeds a predefined large value (indicating no feasible transformation), return -1.\n\n### Steps in Detail\n\n**Step-by-Step Implementation**:\n\n1. **Build the Trie**:\n    - Insert each substring from `original` and `changed` into a trie, assigning unique identifiers to each node.\n\n2. **Initialize Cost Array `g`**:\n    - Set `g[i][i]` to 0 (no cost to transform a substring into itself).\n    - Set all other entries to infinity initially.\n\n3. **Fill `g` with Given Costs**:\n    - For each transformation from `original[i]` to `changed[i]` with a cost `cost[i]`, update `g` accordingly.\n\n4. **Apply Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:\n    - Iterate over all possible pairs `(i, j)` and intermediate `k` to find the minimum cost for every pair.\n\n5. **Define the Recursive Function `dfs(i)`**:\n    - Base Case: If `i` exceeds length of source, return 0 (no cost for no remaining characters).\n    - Check if current characters match. If yes, move to next index.\n    - Otherwise, check possible transformations starting at `i` and compute the total cost including recursive costs of subsequent substrings.\n\n6. **Execute Conversion and Get Result**:\n    - Start DFS from index 0 and compute the result.\n    - Return the resulting cost or -1 if transformation is not possible.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- Use memoization to optimize the recursive function and avoid recomputing costs for the same subproblems.\n- Handle the edge cases where transformations involve overlapping or same indices carefully to ensure disjoint or identical index conditions are met.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis structured approach using trie data structures, Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths, and memoized DFS provides an efficient way to solve the transformation problem with minimum cost.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Node:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"v\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children: List[Node | None] = [None] * 26\n        self.v = -1\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(\n        self,\n        source: str,\n        target: str,\n        original: List[str],\n        changed: List[str],\n        cost: List[int],\n    ) -> int:\n        m = len(cost)\n        g = [[inf] * (m << 1) for _ in range(m << 1)]\n        for i in range(m << 1):\n            g[i][i] = 0\n        root = Node()\n        idx = 0\n\n        def insert(w: str) -> int:\n            node = root\n            for c in w:\n                i = ord(c) - ord(\"a\")\n                if node.children[i] is None:\n                    node.children[i] = Node()\n                node = node.children[i]\n            if node.v < 0:\n                nonlocal idx\n                node.v = idx\n                idx += 1\n            return node.v\n\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int) -> int:\n            if i >= len(source):\n                return 0\n            res = dfs(i + 1) if source[i] == target[i] else inf\n            p = q = root\n            for j in range(i, len(source)):\n                p = p.children[ord(source[j]) - ord(\"a\")]\n                q = q.children[ord(target[j]) - ord(\"a\")]\n                if p is None or q is None:\n                    break\n                if p.v < 0 or q.v < 0:\n                    continue\n                res = min(res, dfs(j + 1) + g[p.v][q.v])\n            return res\n\n        for x, y, z in zip(original, changed, cost):\n            x = insert(x)\n            y = insert(y)\n            g[x][y] = min(g[x][y], z)\n        for k in range(idx):\n            for i in range(idx):\n                if g[i][k] >= inf:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(idx):\n                    # g[i][j] = min(g[i][j], g[i][k] + g[k][j])\n                    if g[i][k] + g[k][j] < g[i][j]:\n                        g[i][j] = g[i][k] + g[k][j]\n\n        ans = dfs(0)\n        return -1 if ans >= inf else ans\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-cost-to-convert-string-ii"]}, "3236": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.

Here is a step-by-step guide to solving the problem of finding the k most frequent elements in an integer array:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solving the Problem\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nYou need to find the k most frequent elements in an array. The frequency of an element refers to the number of times it appears in the array. You will return these k elements in any order.\n\n#### Step 2: Approach\nWe'll use the following approach to efficiently solve the problem:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**: Use a hash table (or dictionary) to count how many times each element appears in the array.\n2. **Keep Track of the Top k Elements**: Use a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the top k frequent elements. If at any point the heap size exceeds k, remove the least frequent element.\n3. **Output the Result**: Convert the elements in the heap to a list of results.\n\n#### Step 3: Implementing the Solution\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse the array and use a dictionary to count occurrences of each element.\n   - For instance, if the array is `[1,1,1,2,2,3]`, your dictionary will look like `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.\n\n2. **Using a Min Heap**:\n   - Use a min heap to store elements based on their frequency.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary and push each entry (element and its frequency) into the heap.\n   - Ensure the heap size does not exceed k. If it does, remove the smallest element (in terms of frequency).\n\n3. **Extract the k Most Frequent Elements**:\n   - Once all elements have been processed, extract the elements from the heap. These will be the k most frequent elements in the array.\n\n#### Step 4: Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize a Dictionary**:\n   - Create a dictionary to store frequencies of elements.\n   - Example: `cnt = {}`.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse each element in the array.\n   - For each element, if it is not present in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1. If it is present, increment its count.\n\n3. **Use a Min Heap**:\n   - Initialize a min heap.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary entries.\n   - For each entry, push it into the heap along with its frequency.\n   - If the heap size exceeds k, pop the smallest element.\n\n4. **Formulate the Result**:\n   - Extract elements from the heap.\n   - These will be your results.\n\n#### Step 5: Optimizations\n- **Time Complexity**: Using a hash table to count elements takes \\(O(n)\\) time, where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array.\n- **Heap Operations**: Inserting and removing from a heap of size k takes \\(O(\\log k)\\) time. Since we perform this for n elements, the time complexity for the heap operations is \\(O(n \\log k)\\).\n- **Space Complexity**: Space for storing counts in the dictionary is \\(O(n)\\). The heap space is \\(O(k)\\). Overall, space complexity is \\(O(n + k)\\).\n\n#### Step 6: Implementation Tips\n- Use the `collections.Counter` class in Python for easy frequency counting.\n- Use the `heapq` module for heap operations, which provides an efficient way to handle priority queues.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem of finding the k most frequent elements in an array.

Paths are considered increasing if every subsequent cell in the path has a strictly higher value than the previous cell.

This avoids redundant calculations and significantly reduces the time complexity.\n\n3. **Base Case**:\n    - If the cell `(i, j)` is already computed and stored in `f`, return the stored value.\n    - Initialize the path count from `(i, j)` as `1` since the cell itself is a valid path of length 1.\n\n4. **Explore Adjacent Cells**:\n    - From any cell `(i, j)`, try moving in the four possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n    - For each direction, if the new cell `(x, y)` is within the grid boundaries and its value is greater than the current cell's value (`grid[x][y] > grid[i][j]`), call `dfs(x, y)` to explore further paths from that cell. Accumulate the number of paths found back to `f[i][j]`.\n\n5. **Sum the Results**:\n    - To get the final answer, sum up the results of calling `dfs` on every cell in the grid.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**:\n    - Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to avoid overflow issues and meet the requirement of the problem statement.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Create the Memoization Table**:\n    - Initialize a 2D list `f` with all elements set to `0`.\n\n2. **Define the DFS Function**:\n    - Inside the DFS function, first check if the current cell result is already in `f`. If so, return it directly.\n    - If not, initialize the path count from the current cell to 1.\n    - Attempt to move in the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), and for each valid move, recursively call `dfs` for the adjacent cell and add the result to the path count.\n    - Store the computed path count in `f` and return it.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n    - Loop through all cells in the grid and call the `dfs` function for each one.\n    - Sum up the results of all these calls, taking care to apply modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the result within bounds.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nConsider this example grid: `[[1,1],[3,4]]`\n- Paths of length 1: [1], [1], [3], [4]\n- Paths of length 2: [1 -> 3], [1 -> 4], [3 -> 4]\n- Paths of length 3: [1 -> 3 -> 4]\n\nThe total number of paths should be calculated and returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Considerations:\n- Ensure to handle edge cases, such as the smallest grids (1x1) or grids where no increasing path is possible except for single-cell paths.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement a solution that finds the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def countPaths(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:\n            ans = 1\n            for a, b in pairwise((-1, 0, 1, 0, -1)):\n                x, y = i + a, j + b\n                if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and grid[i][j] < grid[x][y]:\n                    ans = (ans + dfs(x, y)) % mod\n            return ans\n\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        return sum(dfs(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n)) % mod\n", "problem_ids": ["number-of-increasing-paths-in-a-grid"]}, "3240": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two arrays nums and andValues of length n and m respectively.\nThe value of an array is equal to the last element of that array.\nYou have to divide nums into m disjoint contiguous subarrays such that for the ith subarray [li, ri], the bitwise AND of the subarray elements is equal to andValues[i], in other words, nums[li] & nums[li + 1] & ... & nums[ri] == andValues[i] for all 1 <= i <= m, where & represents the bitwise AND operator.\nReturn the minimum possible sum of the values of the m subarrays nums is divided into.

Your goal is to divide `nums` into `m` contiguous subarrays such that the bitwise AND of the elements of the `i-th` subarray is equal to `andValues[i]`. You then need to find the minimum possible sum of the last elements of these `m` subarrays. If it\u2019s not possible to meet these conditions, you should return `-1`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solving this problem:\n\n#### Step 1: Conceptualize the Solution\n\n1. **Bitwise AND Operation**: Understand that the bitwise AND of a set of numbers results in a number that has only the bits set that are set in all the numbers. For example,  `4 & 7 = 4` (binary: `100 & 111 = 100`).\n   \n2. **Splitting the Array**: Your main task is to identify different points where the array can be split so that the AND operation results in the values specified in `andValues`.\n\n3. **Recursive Exploration**: To systematically explore possible splits, we can use recursion with memoization. This involves defining a function that explores all possible ways to split the array and keeps track of the minimum sum encountered.\n\n#### Step 2: Define Recursive Function\n\nDefine a function `dfs(i, j, a)` where:\n- `i` is the starting index of the current subarray.\n- `j` is the number of subarrays that have already been formed.\n- `a` is the bitwise AND result of the current subarray being considered.\n\nThe function returns the minimum sum of the subarray values starting from index `i` with `j` subarrays already formed and `a` as the current bitwise AND value.\n\n#### Step 3: Base Cases and Recursive Steps\n\n1. **Insufficient Elements**: If the remaining elements in `nums` are fewer than the required subarrays (`n - i < m - j`), return a high value (`inf`). This signifies that no valid division can be made.\n\n2. **Completion Check**: If `j` equals `m` (all required subarrays are formed), check if `i` equals `n` (all elements are used). If so, return `0` because no more elements are left to contribute to the sum; otherwise return `inf`.\n\n3. **AND Operation**: Perform the AND operation with the current value `a` and `nums[i]`. If this result is less than the required `andValues[j]`, it is not possible to form a valid subarray, again return `inf`.\n\n4. **Choices**: \n   - **Not Splitting**: Move to the next element without forming a new subarray: `dfs(i + 1, j, a)`.\n   - **Splitting**: Form a new subarray ending at the current element if `a` matches `andValues[j]`: `dfs(i + 1, j + 1, -1) + nums[i]`.\n\nReturn the minimum of these two choices.\n\n#### Step 4: Memoization\n\nTo prevent recomputation and to handle overlapping subproblems effectively, store results of `dfs(i, j, a)` in a memoization table.\n\n#### Step 5: Initialization and Final Result\n\nStart the recursive function from the beginning of the array with:\n- `i = 0` (starting index),\n- `j = 0` (no subarrays formed initially),\n- `a = -1` (initial value that doesn't affect the AND operation).\n\nThe final result will be the minimum sum calculated by your function. If this sum is infinite, it means no valid division exists, and you should return `-1`.\n\n#### Example Analysis\n\n1. For `nums = [1,4,3,3,2]` and `andValues = [0,3,3,2]`, the function should explore all valid divisions and find the one with the minimum sum of last elements of the subarrays.\n2. For `nums = [2,3,5,7,7,7,5]` and `andValues = [0,7,5]`, multiple divisions might satisfy the conditions, and the function should pick the one with the minimum sum.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n1. If the entire array cannot be split to satisfy the AND conditions, the function should return `-1`.\n2. Ensure to handle arrays and AND values with constraints on length and values properly.\n\nBy following these detailed steps and understanding the base and recursive cases intricately, you can implement an efficient and correct solution to this problem using recursive depth-first search with memoization.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumValueSum(self, nums: List[int], andValues: List[int]) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int, a: int) -> int:\n            if n - i < m - j:\n                return inf\n            if j == m:\n                return 0 if i == n else inf\n            a &= nums[i]\n            if a < andValues[j]:\n                return inf\n            ans = dfs(i + 1, j, a)\n            if a == andValues[j]:\n                ans = min(ans, dfs(i + 1, j + 1, -1) + nums[i])\n            return ans\n\n        n, m = len(nums), len(andValues)\n        ans = dfs(0, 0, -1)\n        return ans if ans < inf else -1\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-sum-of-values-by-dividing-array"]}, "3242": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.\nPartition the cards into one or more groups such that:\n\nEach group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and\nAll the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.\n\nReturn true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: No possible partition.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= deck.length <= 104\n0 <= deck[i] < 104\n\n Solution: \nSure! Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "3243": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2).

The expression needs to be evaluated according to the following rules:\n\n1. **Compute multiplications** from left to right.\n2. **Compute additions** from left to right.\n\nAdditionally, you are provided with an array `answers`, which contains the answers submitted by several students. Your task is to grade each student's answer based on the correctness of the arithmetic operations they performed, possibly considering they may have misinterpreted the order of operations. Points are awarded as follows:\n\n- **5 points** if the student's answer is exactly correct.\n- **2 points** if the student's answer is a valid result of the expression assuming they misinterpreted the order.\n- **0 points** if neither of the above conditions are met.\n\nYou need to compute the total points awarded to the students based on these rules.\n\n#### Breakdown of Solution Approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the Correct Answer:**\n    - Implement a function that evaluates the given string `s` correctly following the specified order: first calculate all multiplications, then additions.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming to Find All Valid Results:**\n    - Use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to store all possible results of sub-expressions in a 2D table `f[i][j]`, where `f[i][j]` stores all possible results from calculating the expression between the `i`-th and `j`-th digits.\n   \n3. **Fill DP Table:**\n    - Initialize the DP table for single digits.\n    - For larger sub-expressions, compute results using previously computed values from smaller sub-expressions, considering all possible places where the expression can be split.\n\n4. **Compute Student Points:**\n    - Check each student's answer against the correct answer.\n    - If it matches, award 5 points.\n    - If it doesn't match but is in the list of possible results (from the DP table), award 2 points.\n    - Otherwise, award 0 points.\n\n#### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Correct Answer:**\n    - Traverse the string `s` and compute the result by:\n      - Multiplying numbers together whenever a `*` is encountered.\n      - Adding the results of multiplications when a `+` is encountered.\n\n2. **Initialize and Fill DP Table:**\n    - Use a 2D list `f` initialized to store sets of possible results for each sub-expression.\n    - For single-digit sub-expressions, simply store the digit itself.\n    - For larger sub-expressions:\n      - Break the expression at each possible point, applying the operator between the resulting sub-expressions.\n      - Store all valid results considering each operation result must not exceed `1000`.\n\n3. **Evaluate Student Answers:**\n    - Use a counter to tally how many times each answer appears in `answers`.\n    - For each answer, check if it matches the correct answer or is in the list of valid sub-expression results.\n    - Sum up the points based on the points criteria given.\n\nUsing this detailed structured approach helps in solving the problem efficiently by breaking it down into manageable parts and utilizing dynamic programming to handle sub-expression calculations effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def scoreOfStudents(self, s: str, answers: List[int]) -> int:\n        def cal(s: str) -> int:\n            res, pre = 0, int(s[0])\n            for i in range(1, n, 2):\n                if s[i] == \"*\":\n                    pre *= int(s[i + 1])\n                else:\n                    res += pre\n                    pre = int(s[i + 1])\n            res += pre\n            return res\n\n        n = len(s)\n        x = cal(s)\n        m = (n + 1) >> 1\n        f = [[set() for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(m)]\n        for i in range(m):\n            f[i][i] = {int(s[i << 1])}\n        for i in range(m -

This is because a strictly increasing order means every element should be greater than its previous one.\n   - For each `nums[i]`, check if it is already less than the next element `nums[i + 1]`. If it is, you can move on to the next element.\n\n3. **Finding the Appropriate Prime:**\n   - If `nums[i]` is not less than `nums[i + 1]`, you need to find a prime `p` such that `p < nums[i] - nums[i + 1]`.\n   - The prime `p` should also be as small as possible to make minimal changes to the array.\n   - You can use binary search on the list of primes to quickly find the required prime.\n\n4. **Perform Subtraction:**\n   - Once you've found the appropriate prime number, subtract it from `nums[i]`.\n   - If no such prime is found that satisfies the condition, then it's impossible to make the array strictly increasing, and you should return `False`.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - If you successfully process all elements in the array and make the necessary changes, the array should be strictly increasing. Return `True`.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Generate Prime Numbers\nUse a sieve or iteration method to generate all prime numbers up to 1000. Store these primes in a list called `primes`.\n\n#### Step 2: Process the Array\nStart from the second last element of `nums` to the first element:\n1. Compare `nums[i]` with `nums[i + 1]`.\n2. If `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`, continue to the next element.\n\n#### Step 3: Find the Appropriate Prime\nFor elements where `nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]`:\n1. Use a binary search to find the smallest prime `p` such that `p < nums[i] - nums[i + 1]`.\n2. Ensure that `nums[i] - p > 0` after the subtraction.\n\n#### Step 4: Subtract the Prime\nSubtract the found prime number from `nums[i]`.\n\n#### Step 5: Check Completion\nIf all elements are processed and adjusted properly, return `True`. If any element fails to find the appropriate prime, return `False`.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\n#### Example 1:\n```plaintext\nnums = [4,9,6,10]\n\n1.

Let's break down this problem and create a detailed guide to help you understand how to solve it step by step. \n\n## Guide to Solving the Problem\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given a string `word` and an integer `k`. Every second, you perform two operations:\n1. Remove the first `k` characters from the beginning of the string.\n2. Add any `k` characters to the end of the string.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds required for the string to revert to its initial state after performing these operations.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### 1. Identify Key Patterns\nTo solve this, we need to observe how the string changes with each operation and identify under what conditions it returns to its original state.\n\n#### 2. Initial Insight\nIf the string reverts to its initial state after one operation, this means that the new string formed after removing the first `k` characters and adding `k` characters to the end is identical to the original string.\n\nTo generalize, if the string reverts to its initial state after `i` operations, it implies that the part of the new string starting from the `(k * i)`-th character should match the prefix of the original string of length `n - (k * i)`, where `n` is the length of the string.\n\n#### 3. Plan of Action\nWe will:\n1. Iterate over possible values of `i` (number of operations).\n2. For each `i`, check if the substring starting from the `k * i`-th character matches the prefix of length `n - k * i` of the original string.\n3. The first `i` that satisfies this condition will be our desired result.\n\n#### 4. Detailed Steps\n- **Calculate Length**: Determine the length `n` of the string `word`.\n- **Loop Through Possible Seconds**:\n  - Loop from `i = 1` to some appropriate upper limit.\n  - Check if the substring `word[k*i:]` matches the prefix `word[:n-k*i]`.\n  - If they match, return `i` as it indicates the string has reverted to its initial state after `i` seconds.\n- **Return Default Value**: If no match is found in the loop, return a default value calculated based on `(n + k - 1) // k`. This would be when no smaller `i` satisfies the condition for a complete cycle.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\n#### Example 1:\n- Word: \"abacaba\", k: 3\n  - At second 1:\n    - Remove \"aba\", add \"bac\": becomes \"cababac\"\n  - At second 2:\n    - Remove \"cab\", add \"aba\": becomes \"abacaba\", matches the original.\n  - Answer is 2 seconds.\n\n#### Example 2:\n- Word: \"abacaba\", k: 4\n  - At second 1:\n    - Remove \"abac\", add \"caba\": becomes \"abacaba\", matches the original.\n  - Answer is 1 second.\n\n#### Example 3:\n- Word: \"abcbabcd\", k: 2\n  - At second 1:\n    - Remove \"ab\", add \"bc\": becomes \"cbabcdab\"\n  - At second 2:\n    - Remove \"cb\", add \"ab\": becomes \"abcdabcb\"\n  - At second 3:\n    - Remove \"ab\" again, increase time and check subsequent sections similarly.\n  - At second 4:\n    - Finally matches the original \"abcbabcd\".\n  - Answer is 4 seconds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can systematically determine the minimum number of seconds required for the string to revert to its original state. This involves checking each increment of operations to see when the string matches its initial form, ensuring that you consider all possible valid scenarios for the string length and value of `k`.\n\nBy practicing this method, you'll develop a strong understanding of string manipulation and pattern recognition in programming.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTimeToInitialState(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(word)\n        for i in range(k, n, k):\n            if word[i:] == word[:-i]:\n                return i // k\n        return (n + k - 1) // k\n", "problem_ids": ["minimum-time-to-revert-word-to-initial-state-i"]}, "3246": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "3252": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA split of an integer array is good if:\n\nThe array is split into three non-empty contiguous subarrays - named left, mid, right respectively from left to right.\nThe sum of the elements in left is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in mid, and the sum of the elements in mid is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in right.\n\nGiven nums, an array of non-negative integers, return the number of good ways to split nums.

Let's walk through a detailed step-by-step guide to help you understand how to solve this problem of counting good splits in an array. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given an array of non-negative integers, and you need to find ways to split it into three non-empty contiguous subarrays (left, mid, and right) such that:\n\n1. The sum of the elements in the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the mid subarray.\n2. The sum of the elements in the mid subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the right subarray.\n\n### Strategy to Solve the Problem\n\nTo efficiently count the number of good ways to split the array, we can leverage the properties of the prefix sum array and binary search:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Calculate the prefix sum array `s` where `s[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the input array. This helps us quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n2. **Monotonic Property**: Since the prefix sum array `s` is monotonically increasing (because all elements are non-negative), we can use this property to find efficient ways to partition into left, mid, and right subarrays.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each possible ending index of the left subarray, use binary search to find the valid range for the starting and ending indices of the mid subarray.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Compute the Prefix Sum Array**: First, construct the prefix sum array `s` for the given array `nums`.\n\n2. **Iterate and Apply Binary Search**: For each possible end index `i` of the left subarray, perform binary searches to ensure:\n   - The sum of the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the mid subarray.\n   - The sum of the mid subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the right subarray.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Splits**: During the iteration, count all valid splits using the ranges found by the binary searches.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a prefix sum array `s`.\n   - Initialize a variable `ans` to hold the count of good splits.\n\n2. **Compute Prefix Sum**:\n   - Loop through the list to create the prefix sum array `s`.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Possible Left Splits**:\n   - For each index `i` from the start to `n-2` (as the left subarray should not cover the whole array):\n     - Use binary search to find the smallest index `j` such that the sum of the elements in the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the mid subarray.\n     - Use another binary search to find the largest index `k` such that the sum of the elements in the mid subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the right subarray.\n     \n4. **Count Valid Splits**:\n   - For each valid index range `[j, k)` found, count the number of valid ways to split by adding `k - j` to `ans`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - As the final count may be very large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\n### Pseudocode (High-Level Overview)\n\n```python\n# Function to compute number of good splits\ndef waysToSplit(nums):\n    mod = 10**9 + 7\n    # Compute prefix sum array\n    s = [0] * len(nums)\n    s[0] = nums[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        s[i] = s[i-1] + nums[i]\n    \n    ans = 0\n    n = len(nums)\n    \n    # Iterate over possible ending indexes of the left subarray\n    for i in range(n - 2):\n        j = find_min_j_using_binary_search(s, s[i], i + 1, n - 1)\n        k = find_max_k_using_binary_search(s, s[i], j, n - 1)\n        ans += max(0, k - j)\n    \n    return ans % mod\n```\n\n### Tips\n\n- Ensure you understand how the prefix sum array helps in computing subarray sums efficiently.\n- Practicing binary search will help in implementing the find_min_j_using_binary_search and find_max_k_using_binary_search functions effectively.\n- Make sure to handle edge cases such as very small arrays or arrays with uniform values.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the logic behind each part of the solution, you will be able to tackle this problem efficiently.

Your goal is to split this array into one or more contiguous subarrays such that:\n1. Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.\n2. The sum of the \"scores\" of each subarray is minimized. The score of a subarray is defined as the bitwise AND of all its elements.\n\nYou need to determine the maximum number of subarrays you can achieve while satisfying these conditions.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n- **Bitwise AND Operation**: The bitwise AND operation between two integers results in a number where each bit is 1 if, and only if, the corresponding bits of both operands are 1.\n- **Subarray**: A contiguous section of an array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3]` and `[1, 2]` are subarrays.\n\n#### Plan and Strategy\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a `score` variable with a special value (e.g., -1). This variable keeps track of the score of the current subarray you are building.\n2. **Traversal and Bitwise AND**: Traverse through the array. For each element, perform a bitwise AND operation between the current `score` and the current element.\n3. **Splitting Condition**: If the `score` becomes zero, this means the current subarray's score is minimized (since zero is the smallest possible result of any bitwise AND). Split the subarray here and reset the `score`.\n4. **Counting Subarrays**: Maintain a counter for the number of subarrays. Every time you split the array (when `score` = 0), increment the counter.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n    - A `score` variable to keep track of the AND result of the current subarray. Start it with a value that will make the initial AND operation straightforward (like -1, since ANDing any number with -1 returns the number itself).\n    - An `ans` variable to count the number of subarrays. Start with 1 since there is at least one subarray (the whole array).\n\n2. **Traverse Through Array Elements**:\n    - For each element in the array, update the `score` by performing a bitwise AND operation with the current element.\n    - If at any point `score` becomes 0, it means we have minimized the score for the current subarray. This is the point to split and start a new subarray.\n    - Reset the `score` to -1 to begin the next subarray.\n\n3. **Check for Results**:\n    - After traversing the array, you will have the count of how many times you were able to split the array.\n    - There is a special case: if the array was never split (you only have one subarray), ensure that your answer reflects it appropriately. \n\n4. **Return the Count**:\n    - Return the total number of subarrays that achieve the minimum possible score sum. Remember to adjust the answer if it reflects the count in a different indexing base.\n\nWith these steps in mind, you should be able to implement the logic to solve the problem effectively. The approach is both efficient in terms of time complexity (O(n)) and space complexity (O(1)), as it only requires a single pass through the array and maintains a constant amount of additional storage.\n\nBy following this guide, you should be able to develop a correct and efficient solution to the problem.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        score, ans = -1, 1\n        for num in nums:\n            score &= num\n            if score == 0:\n                score = -1\n                ans += 1\n        return 1 if ans == 1 else ans - 1\n", "problem_ids": ["split-array-into-maximum-number-of-subarrays"]}, "3262": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array of positive integers beans, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.\nRemove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal.

This will be used to determine how many beans need to be removed.\n\n4. **Enumerate Each Bag's Beans as the Target**:\n   - Iterate over each unique bean count in the sorted array and consider this as the possible target number of beans for the remaining non-empty bags.\n   - For each bean count in the enumeration, all bags with more beans than this count will need beans removed to match this count.\n\n5. **Remaining Beans Calculation**:\n   - For each target count, calculate the total number of remaining beans if every bag with more beans than this target count is reduced to this number.\n   - The formula to calculate remaining beans is: `target_count \u00d7 number_of_bags_with_at_least_target_beans`\n   - To determine how many beans need to be removed for this target, subtract the remaining beans from the total number of beans.\n\n6. **Find the Minimum Removal**:\n   - Track the minimum number of beans that need to be removed across all possible target counts.\n\n#### Detailed Algorithm\n\n1. **Sort the Array**:\n   - Start by sorting the array of beans in ascending order.\n   - Example: If your input is `[4, 1, 6, 5]`, after sorting, it will be `[1, 4, 5, 6]`.\n\n2. **Compute Total Beans**:\n   - Calculate the sum of beans in the array.\n   - Example: `1 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 16`\n\n3. **Iterate and Calculate Removal for Each Target**:\n   - Loop through the sorted array and for each bean count at index `i`:\n     - Calculate the number of beans that would remain if all bags with more beans than the current bean count are reduced to that count.\n     - The number of remaining beans for target `beans[i]` is given by `beans[i] * (total_bags - i)`, where `total_bags` is the total number of bags.\n     - Calculate beans to remove: `total_beans - remaining_beans`\n\n4. **Track Minimum Beans to Remove**:\n   - Keep a running track of the minimum number of beans removed over all iterations.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nGiven `beans = [4, 1, 6, 5]`:\n\n1. **Sort the array**: `[1, 4, 5, 6]`\n2. **Total beans**: `16`\n\nIterate over each element:\n- For target `1` (index `0`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `1` bean: `1 * (4 - 0) = 4`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 4 = 12`\n- For target `4` (index `1`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `4` beans: `4 * (4 - 1) = 12`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 12 = 4`\n- For target `5` (index `2`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `5` beans: `5 * (4 - 2) = 10`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 10 = 6`\n- For target `6` (index `3`):\n  - Remaining beans if every bag had `6` beans: `6 * (4 - 3) = 6`\n  - Beans to remove: `16 - 6 = 10`\n\nThe minimum beans removed are `4` for target `4`.\n\nBy following this detailed approach, you will be able to systematically determine the minimum number of beans to remove, ensuring all non-empty bags have the same number of beans.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimumRemoval(self, beans: List[int]) -> int:\n        beans.sort()\n        s, n = sum(beans), len(beans)\n        return min(s - x * (n - i) for i, x in enumerate(beans))\n", "problem_ids": ["removing-minimum-number-of-magic-beans"]}, "3265": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given two 0-indexed binary arrays nums1 and nums2.

This means for each index \\(i\\):\n    \\[ differences[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i] \\]\n\n2. **Use Prefix Sums and Hash Table**:\n    - Define a prefix sum \\(s\\) which will help in calculating the cumulative sum up to any index. Initialize this to zero.\n    - Use a hash table (dictionary) to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum. Initialize this with the entry (0, -1) to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning has a sum of zero.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compute**:\n    - Traverse through each element of the \"differences\" array, calculating the prefix sum at each step.\n    - For each prefix sum, check if it has been seen before in the hash table:\n        - If yes, it means there is a subarray (from the first occurrence + 1 to the current index) with a sum of zero. Update the answer if the current subarray is the widest so far.\n        - If no, store the current prefix sum with its index in the hash table for the first time.\n    - Continue this process until you've examined all elements.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n    - The answer stored will be the distance of the widest (i, j) pair found.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n    - Declare a dictionary `d` to store prefix sums and their first occurrences. Initialize it with `{0: -1}`.\n    - Initialize variables `ans` (to track the widest distance) and `s` (for the running prefix sum) to 0.\n\n2. **Traverse the Arrays**:\n    - For each index \\(i\\), compute the difference between elements of nums1 and nums2, and add this to the running prefix sum \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Update the Hash Table**:\n    - Check if this prefix sum \\(s\\) is already in the dictionary `d`:\n        - If it is, calculate the distance using \\(i - d[s]\\) and update `ans` if this distance is larger than the current maximum.\n        - If it is not in the dictionary, store \\(s\\) with the current index \\(i\\).\n\n4. **Completion**:\n    - After the entire array has been processed, the value of `ans` will be the result.\n\nBy following these steps, the algorithm efficiently finds the widest pair of indices with equal sums in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity and \\(O(n)\\) space complexity due to the use of prefix sums and a hash table for quick lookups.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def widestPairOfIndices(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:\n        d = {0: -1}\n        ans = s = 0\n        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(nums1, nums2)):\n            s += a - b\n            if s in d:\n                ans = max(ans, i - d[s])\n            else:\n                d[s] = i\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["widest-pair-of-indices-with-equal-range-sum"]}, "3267": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.\nA string is called special if it is made up of only a single character.

Calculate the middle point `mid` as the average of `l` and `r`.\n        2. Use a helper function `check(mid)` to determine if there exists any special substring of length `mid` that appears at least three times.\n        3. If `check(mid)` returns true, it means we can look for even longer substrings, so update the lower boundary to `mid`.\n        4. If `check(mid)` returns false, it implies no such substring exists; hence, update the upper boundary to `mid - 1`.\n    - End of binary search: if `l` results in `0`, return `-1` indicating no valid substring found; otherwise, return `l`.\n\n3. **Helper Function (check)**:\n    - This function verifies if a special substring of given length `x` exists.\n    - Initialize a hash table or an array to count occurrences of special substrings for each character.\n    - Traverse through the string:\n        1. For each character, count the length of contiguous substrings of the same character.\n        2. If a contiguous substring is at least of length `x`, increment the count for that character by the number of possible substrings of this length within that segment.\n    - Finally, check if any character's count in the hash map is at least 3 (indicating that a special substring of length `x` appears at least thrice).\n\n### Execution \n1. **Initialize Search Boundaries**:\n    - Start binary search with `l = 0` and `r` as the length of the string `n`.\n\n2. **Binary Search Loop**:\n    - Continue until `l < r`.\n    - Calculate the midpoint.\n    - Check if valid special substrings of length `mid` exist using the helper function.\n    - Adjust the search boundaries based on the result.\n\n3. **Final Result**:\n    - After binary search concludes, determine the maximum special substring length that meets the criteria.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n- For the string \"aaaa\":\n    - Binary search starts with `l = 0` and `r = 4`.\n    - `check(mid)` where `mid` varies; you'll find that \"aa\" is the longest substring that appears thrice.\n\n- For the string \"abcdef\":\n    - Binary search shows no special substring of length >= 1 appears thrice.\n    - Final result should be `-1`.\n\n### Tips:\n- Focus on understanding the monotonic property of substring lengths.\n- Carefully implement the sliding window in the `check` function to count the substrings efficiently.\n- Pay attention to edge cases, such as strings with no repeating characters or entirely made of one character.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to approach and solve the coding problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def maximumLength(self, s: str) -> int:\n        def check(x: int) -> bool:\n            cnt = defaultdict(int)\n            i = 0\n            while i < n:\n                j = i + 1\n                while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                    j += 1\n                cnt[s[i]] += max(0, j - i - x + 1)\n                i = j\n            return max(cnt.values()) >= 3\n\n        n = len(s)\n        l, r = 0, n\n        while l < r:\n            mid = (l + r + 1) >> 1\n            if check(mid):\n                l = mid\n            else:\n                r = mid - 1\n        return -1 if l == 0 else l\n", "problem_ids": ["find-longest-special-substring-that-occurs-thrice-ii"]}, "3269": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a binary array pattern and an object stream of class InfiniteStream representing a 0-indexed infinite stream of bits.\nThe class InfiniteStream contains the following function:\n\nint next(): Reads a single bit (which is either 0 or 1) from the stream and returns it.\n\nReturn the first starting index where the pattern matches the bits read from the stream.

Understand the Problem\nYou are given a stream of bits that, although infinite, can be accessed one bit at a time using the `next()` method. Additionally, you are given a fixed-length pattern that you need to match against this stream. Your goal is to find the first position in the stream where this pattern starts.\n\n#### 2. Pattern Representation\nSince the maximum length of the pattern is 100, you can leverage the power of 64-bit integers to simplify and speed up comparisons:\n- Represent the first half of the pattern using a 64-bit integer `a`.\n- Represent the second half of the pattern using another 64-bit integer `b`.\n\nUsing two integers is helpful because comparing two integers is faster than comparing two arrays.\n\n#### 3. Encoding the Pattern\nEncode the pattern into two separate 64-bit integers:\n- Split the pattern into two halves.\n- Use bitwise operations to store the bits of the pattern into `a` and `b`.\n\n#### 4. Sliding Window Technique\nUse a sliding window approach to read the stream and compare it with the encoded pattern:\n- Maintain two 64-bit integers `x` and `y` for the current window in the stream.\n- Continuously shift bits into `x` and `y` as you read new bits from the stream.\n  \n#### 5. Bit Manipulation\n- Initiate reading the stream and keep shifting bits into your current window.\n- Use masks to isolate the correct number of bits that match the length of the halves of the pattern.\n\n#### 6. Comparison\nEach time the window reaches the length of the pattern:\n- Compare the encoded pattern (`a` and `b`) with the current window (`x` and `y`).\n- If they match, return the starting index of the pattern in the stream.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - `a` and `b` for encoded pattern halves.\n   - `x` and `y` for current window halves.\n   - Masks to isolate the correct bits.\n\n2. **Encode the Pattern**:\n   - Determine `m` as the length of the pattern.\n   - Calculate `half` as half the length of the pattern.\n   - Generate masks: `mask1` for the first half, and `mask2` for the second half.\n   - Loop through the first half of the pattern and shift bits into `a`.\n   - Loop through the second half and shift bits into `b`.\n\n3. **Stream Reading and Window Update**:\n   - Initialize an infinite loop to read the stream one bit at a time.\n   - Shift the new bit into `y`.\n   - Isolate the bit to shift into `x` by shifting effectively and applying the mask.\n   - Shift into `x` and apply the mask to maintain the correct number of bits.\n\n4. **Pattern Match Check**:\n   - Once you have read `m` bits in total, compare `a` with `x` and `b` with `y`.\n   - If both match, you have found the starting index. Return it.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\n- **Bitwise Operations**: Brush up on left shift (`<<`), right shift (`>>`), bitwise AND (`&`), and bitwise OR (`|`) operations as they are crucial for this problem.\n- **Masks**: Understand how to create and use masks to isolate specific bits of the binary number.\n- **Optimizing Comparisons**: Leveraging 64-bit integers drastically reduces the time complexity compared to direct array comparisons for each window position.\n\nBy following this detailed guide, you should be able to design and implement an efficient solution to find the first occurrence of a pattern in an infinite bit stream.\n\n Solution Code: \n# Definition for an infinite stream.\n# class InfiniteStream:\n#     def next(self) -> int:\n#         pass\nclass Solution:\n    def findPattern(\n        self, stream: Optional[\"InfiniteStream\"], pattern: List[int]\n    ) -> int:\n        a = b = 0\n        m = len(pattern)\n        half = m >> 1\n        mask1 = (1 << half) - 1\n        mask2 = (1 << (m - half)) - 1\n        for i in range(half):\n            a |= pattern[i] << (half - 1 - i)\n        for i in range(half, m):\n            b |= pattern[i] << (m - 1 - i)\n        x = y = 0\n        for i in count(1):\n            v = stream.next()\n            y = y << 1 | v\n            v = y >> (m - half) & 1\n            y &= mask2\n            x = x << 1 | v\n            x &= mask1\n            if i >= m and a == x and b == y:\n                return i - m\n", "problem_ids": ["find-pattern-in-infinite-stream-i"]}, "3279": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an integer n and an integer start.\nDefine an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2 * i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.\nReturn the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, start = 0\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.\nWhere \"^\" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, start = 3\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= start <= 1000\nn == nums.length\n\n Solution: \n## How to Solve the XOR Operation Problem: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIn this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to solve a problem involving the bitwise XOR operation on elements of an array. Let's break down the problem and tackle it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given two integers, `n` and `start`. Using these, you need to construct an array `nums` where each element is defined as follows:\n- `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (where `i` is the index of the element, starting from 0).\n\nFor instance, if `n = 5` and `start = 0`:\n- `nums` would be `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.\n\nYour task is to return the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the `nums` array. \n\nBitwise XOR is a binary operation that follows these rules:\n- 0 XOR 0 = 0\n- 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nFollow the steps below to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize an Array to Store the Elements**: \n\n   Create an array `nums` where each element is calculated using the formula `nums[i] = start + 2 * i`. This array is defined for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Element**:\n\n   Iterate through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and calculate the value of `nums[i]`.\n\n3. **Compute the XOR for All Elements**:\n\n   Initialize a variable to store the XOR result. As you iterate over the elements of the array, update this variable by XORing it with each element. This can be done using a loop.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Create the Array**:\n   - Declare an array called `nums` with a length of `n`.\n   - Loop from `0` to `n-1` to fill the array, where each element `nums[i]` is calculated as `start + 2 * i`.\n\n2. **Calculate XOR**:\n   - Initialize a variable, say `xor_result`, to `0`.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you solve this problem:\n\n### Guide to Solve the Array Sorting Problem\n\n#### Introduction\nYou are given an integer array, and you need to sort this array based on the binary representation of the integers. Specifically, you have two criteria for sorting:\n1. First, sort the integers in ascending order based on the number of 1's in their binary representations.\n2. If two or more integers have the same number of 1's, sort them in ascending order by their numerical value.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understand Binary Representation:**\n   - Each integer can be represented in binary format. For example, the integer `5` can be represented as `101`, which has two 1's.\n   - You need to count the number of 1's in the binary representation for each integer.\n\n2. **Plan the Sorting Criteria:**\n   - Your primary sorting key will be the number of 1's in the binary representation.\n   - If two integers have the same number of 1's, then the secondary sorting key will be the integer value itself.\n\n3. **Approach to Solve the Problem:**\n   - Traverse through each integer in the array.\n   - For each integer, compute the number of 1's in its binary representation.\n   - Use these counts along with the integer values to sort the array.\n\n4. **Break Down the Steps:**\n   - Create a function or method to count the number of 1's in the binary representation of an integer.\n   - Use a sorting mechanism that allows you to sort by multiple criteria. In most programming languages, you can sort using a custom key.\n   - Sort the array using the custom sorting key defined by the number of 1's and the integer value itself.\n\n5. **Coding Tips:**\n   - Utilize built-in functions to convert integers to their binary form and count the 1's.\n   - Use a stable sorting algorithm which maintains the relative order of elements with equal keys. Most high-level sorting functions in programming languages are stable.\n   - Store the counts in a way that they can be accessed efficiently during sorting.\n\n#### Sample Outline (Pseudocode)\n\n1. Write a function to count the number of 1's in the binary representation:\n   ```plaintext\n   function countOnes(x):\n       return count of 1's in binary representation of x\n   ```\n\n2. Sort the array using a custom key:\n   ```plaintext\n   function sortByBits(arr):\n       sort arr by (countOnes(x), x)\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n3. Implement the main logic to call these functions and handle the array sorting.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\nLet's walk through an example:\n\n- Input array: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`\n- Convert each integer to binary and count the 1's:\n  - `0` -> `0` -> 0 bit.\n  - `1` -> `1` -> 1 bit.\n  - `2` -> `10` -> 1 bit.\n  - `3` -> `11` -> 2 bits.\n  - `4` -> `100` -> 1 bit.\n  - `5` -> `101` -> 2 bits.\n  - `6` -> `110` -> 2 bits.\n  - `7` -> `111` -> 3 bits.\n  - `8` -> `1000` -> 1 bit.\n\n- Then, sort primarily by the bit count, and secondarily by the integer value:\n  - `[0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7]`\n\nBy following this guide, you should be able to sort the array as per the problem\u2019s requirements. Remember to leverage built-in functions for binary conversion and sorting to make your implementation more efficient. Happy coding!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def sortByBits(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (x.bit_count(), x))\n", "problem_ids": ["sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits"]}, "3292": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nA split of an integer array is good if:\n\nThe array is split into three non-empty contiguous subarrays - named left, mid, right respectively from left to right.\nThe sum of the elements in left is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in mid, and the sum of the elements in mid is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in right.\n\nGiven nums, an array of non-negative integers, return the number of good ways to split nums.

Let's walk through a detailed step-by-step guide to help you understand how to solve this problem of counting good splits in an array. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nYou are given an array of non-negative integers, and you need to find ways to split it into three non-empty contiguous subarrays (left, mid, and right) such that:\n\n1. The sum of the elements in the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the mid subarray.\n2. The sum of the elements in the mid subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the right subarray.\n\n### Strategy to Solve the Problem\n\nTo efficiently count the number of good ways to split the array, we can leverage the properties of the prefix sum array and binary search:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Calculate the prefix sum array `s` where `s[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the input array. This helps us quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n2. **Monotonic Property**: Since the prefix sum array `s` is monotonically increasing (because all elements are non-negative), we can use this property to find efficient ways to partition into left, mid, and right subarrays.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each possible ending index of the left subarray, use binary search to find the valid range for the starting and ending indices of the mid subarray.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Compute the Prefix Sum Array**: First, construct the prefix sum array `s` for the given array `nums`.\n\n2. **Iterate and Apply Binary Search**: For each possible end index `i` of the left subarray, perform binary searches to ensure:\n   - The sum of the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the mid subarray.\n   - The sum of the mid subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the right subarray.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Splits**: During the iteration, count all valid splits using the ranges found by the binary searches.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a prefix sum array `s`.\n   - Initialize a variable `ans` to hold the count of good splits.\n\n2. **Compute Prefix Sum**:\n   - Loop through the list to create the prefix sum array `s`.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Possible Left Splits**:\n   - For each index `i` from the start to `n-2` (as the left subarray should not cover the whole array):\n     - Use binary search to find the smallest index `j` such that the sum of the elements in the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the mid subarray.\n     - Use another binary search to find the largest index `k` such that the sum of the elements in the mid subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the right subarray.\n     \n4. **Count Valid Splits**:\n   - For each valid index range `[j, k)` found, count the number of valid ways to split by adding `k - j` to `ans`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - As the final count may be very large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\n### Pseudocode (High-Level Overview)\n\n```python\n# Function to compute number of good splits\ndef waysToSplit(nums):\n    mod = 10**9 + 7\n    # Compute prefix sum array\n    s = [0] * len(nums)\n    s[0] = nums[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        s[i] = s[i-1] + nums[i]\n    \n    ans = 0\n    n = len(nums)\n    \n    # Iterate over possible ending indexes of the left subarray\n    for i in range(n - 2):\n        j = find_min_j_using_binary_search(s, s[i], i + 1, n - 1)\n        k = find_max_k_using_binary_search(s, s[i], j, n - 1)\n        ans += max(0, k - j)\n    \n    return ans % mod\n```\n\n### Tips\n\n- Ensure you understand how the prefix sum array helps in computing subarray sums efficiently.\n- Practicing binary search will help in implementing the find_min_j_using_binary_search and find_max_k_using_binary_search functions effectively.\n- Make sure to handle edge cases such as very small arrays or arrays with uniform values.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the logic behind each part of the solution, you will be able to tackle this problem efficiently.

The operations allowed are:\n1. Delete the entire string.\n2. Delete the first *i* letters of **s** if the first *i* letters are equal to the following *i* letters.\n\nTo approach this problem, we will use a method called **Memoization Search**. Here is a step-by-step guide to solve the problem:\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Function\n\nWe need to design a function **`dfs(i)`** that represents the maximum number of operations needed to delete all characters starting from the ith position of the string **s**. The final answer will be given by `dfs(0)` since it considers deleting the entire string from the initial position.\n\n#### Step 2: Base Case\n\nFirst, define the base case of the function:\n- If `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the string **n**, then no operations are needed, so `dfs(i)` should return 0.\n\n#### Step 3: Recursive Calculation\n\nFor the general case, you need to:\n1. Set a variable to store the maximum number of operations possible, initialized to 1. This counts the operation of deleting the entire remaining substring.\n2. Enumerate through possible lengths **j** of the prefix to delete, ranging from 1 to `(n - i) // 2`. This upper bound ensures that the substring to be compared is within the bounds of the string.\n\n#### Step 4: Matching Substrings\n\nFor each **j**, check if the first **j** letters starting from position `i` are equal to the next **j** letters starting from position `i + j`:\n- If `s[i:i+j] == s[i+j:i+2*j]`, it means you can delete the first **j** letters.\n\n#### Step 5: Recursive Call\n\nIf the condition is met, call `dfs(i + j)` to find out the maximum operations for the remaining string starting from the position `i + j`, and update the maximum number of operations. Hence, the updated maximum number of operations will be `1 + dfs(i + j)`.\n\n#### Step 6: Memoization\n\nTo avoid recalculating results for the same starting position **i**, use a memoization technique:\n- Store the value of `dfs(i)` in an array or a cache once it is calculated, and use the stored value for any subsequent calls to `dfs(i)`.\n\n#### Step 7: Preprocessing (Optional but Useful)\n\nWhile implementing, preprocess the longest common prefixes for faster substring comparison. You can store this in a 2D array where `g[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings starting at **i** and **j**.\n\n#### Step 8: Implementation\n\nFinally, implement this logic in your programming environment. Run through test cases to validate your solution. The algorithm should run in O(n^2) time complexity due to the nested loops and string comparisons, and it should take O(n^2) space complexity to store the memoized results.\n\nHere's the outline of the approach to help you implement the solution step by step:\n\n1. Define the function `dfs(i)` with memoization, initializing your main variable to store the result.\n2. Handle the base case.\n3. Loop through possible lengths `j`.\n4. Check for matching substrings and recursively call `dfs`.\n5. Store and return the value to avoid recomputation.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to solve the problem and calculate the maximum operations needed to delete the string optimally!\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def deleteString(self, s: str) -> int:\n        @cache\n        def dfs(i: int) -> int:\n            if i == n:\n                return 0\n            ans = 1\n            for j in range(1, (n - i) // 2 + 1):\n                if s[i : i + j] == s[i + j : i + j + j]:\n                    ans = max(ans, 1 + dfs(i + j))\n            return ans\n\n        n = len(s)\n        return dfs(0)\n", "problem_ids": ["maximum-deletions-on-a-string"]}, "3298": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k.\nA subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k.\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array nums.\nA subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums.

We\u2019ll call such subsets \"beautiful subsets.\"\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Subset**: A subset is an array formed by deleting some (possibly none) elements from the original array.\n2. **Beautiful Subset**: A subset where no two elements have an absolute difference equal to \\( k \\).\n\n### Steps to Approach the Problem\n\n1. **Use Backtracking**: We will use a method called backtracking to explore all possible subsets. Backtracking helps us systematically search through all the subsets by including or excluding each element.\n\n2. **Track Selected Elements**: We need to track which elements have been chosen so far in our current subset. This helps in checking if a new element can be added without violating the beautiful subset condition.\n\n3. **Base Cases**: If we\u2019ve considered all elements, it\u2019s time to count our current subset as a beautiful subset if it meets the required conditions.\n\n4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element, we will decide whether to include it or not in the current subset and recursively explore these two possibilities for all the elements.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Counters**:\n   - Use a hash table (or a simple dictionary) to keep track of the counts of each chosen element. This helps quickly check if adding a new element would violate the \\( k \\)-difference rule with already chosen elements.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Function**:\n   - The function should take the current index and make decisions at each step whether to include or exclude the current element.\n   - If we include an element, check if it satisfies the conditions by ensuring neither the element plus \\( k \\) nor the element minus \\( k \\) are present already in the subset.\n   - If so, update the count of this element and recursively explore further.\n   - After exploring with inclusion, backtrack by reducing the count of this element, thereby deselecting it.\n\n3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**:\n   - For each subset generated through the recursive function, if it meets the conditions, count it as a beautiful subset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to exclude the empty subset as it\u2019s not considered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a counter to track the inclusion of elements.\n   - Initialize the answer variable to store the count of beautiful subsets, starting from -1 to exclude counting the empty subset.\n\n2. **Recursive Function (DFS)**:\n   - If the current index is beyond the array length, increment the beautiful subset counter and return.\n   - First, explore the path where the current element is not included.\n   - Then check if including the current element violates the beautiful subset condition by verifying if `current element + k` or `current element - k` exists in the counter.\n   - If not, include the current element, update the counter, and recursively call the function for the next element.\n   - After the recursive call, backtrack by decrementing the counter for the current element.\n\n3. **Execute the Function**:\n   - Start the recursive function from the first index.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Once the recursion completes, return the count of beautiful subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode for Clarity\n\nHere\u2019s a more abstract outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Define a recursive function `dfs(index)`:\n   - If `index` is out of bounds, increment the subset count and return.\n   - Call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore the subset without the current element.\n   - Check conditions for including the current element:\n     - If valid, include it by updating the counter and call `dfs(index + 1)` to explore further.\n     - Backtrack by decrementing the counter.\n\n2. Initiate the counter and subset count.\n3. Call the `dfs(0)` to start from the first element.\n4. Return the final count of beautiful subsets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement the solution to find all beautiful subsets of the given array.

Hence, it includes cells:\n     - (x, y)\n     - (x+1, y)\n     - (x, y+1)\n     - (x+1, y+1)\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - You need to provide an array `arr` where:\n     - `arr[0]` is the number of 2x2 blocks with 0 black cells.\n     - `arr[1]` to `arr[4]` are the number of blocks with exactly 1, 2, 3, and 4 black cells, respectively.\n\n#### Step 2: **Analyze the Contribution of Each Black Cell**\n\n- A black cell at (x, y) can potentially affect up to 4 submatrices:\n  - Top-left block: (x-1, y-1)\n  - Top-right block: (x-1, y)\n  - Bottom-left block: (x, y-1)\n  - Bottom-right block: (x, y)\n\n  Only consider valid blocks, i.e., blocks whose indices are within grid bounds.\n\n#### Step 3: **Use a Hash Table to Track Block Contributions**\n\n1. **Initialize a Counter**:\n   - Use a hash table (or Counter) to keep track of how many black cells each valid 2x2 block contains.\n\n2. **Traverse Coordinates**:\n   - For each black cell, increment the count of black cells for all valid affected blocks.\n\n#### Step 4: **Count the Number of Blocks with Exactly i Black Cells**\n\n1. **Initialize an Answer Array**:\n   - Create an array `arr` with 5 elements initialized to 0.\n\n2. **Process the Counter**:\n   - Traverse the values in the hash table.\n   - For each count value (1 to 4), increment the corresponding index in the answer array.\n\n3. **Compute Number of Blocks with 0 Black Cells**:\n   - Compute the total number of 2x2 blocks in the grid: (m-1)*(n-1).\n   - Subtract the total counted blocks from the total possible blocks to get the count of 0-black-cell blocks, `arr[0]`.\n\n#### Step 5: **Edge Cases**\n\n- If there are no black cells, all the blocks will contain 0 black cells.\n\n#### Example to Illustrate:\n\nLet's go through a small example for better understanding:\n\nGiven `m = 3`, `n = 3`, `coordinates = [[0,0]]`.\n\n- **Grid Analysis**:\n  ```\n    Black cells: (0,0)\n    Valid blocks affected: \n    (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n  ```\n\n- **Counting Black Cells**:\n  - For black cell at (0,0):\n    - Increase count for block starting at (0,0).\n\n- **Creating the Answer Array**:\n  ```\n    Total blocks = (3-1)*(3-1) = 4\n    Blocks with 0 black cells: 3\n    Blocks with 1 black cell: 1\n  ```\n\n- **Final Answer**:\n  - `arr = [3, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically determine the number of blocks containing exactly i black cells for any valid input grid configuration.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def countBlackBlocks(\n        self, m: int, n: int, coordinates: List[List[int]]\n    ) -> List[int]:\n        cnt = Counter()\n        for x, y in coordinates:\n            for a, b in pairwise((0, 0, -1, -1, 0)):\n                i, j = x + a, y + b\n                if 0 <= i < m - 1 and 0 <= j < n - 1:\n                    cnt[(i, j)] += 1\n        ans = [0] * 5\n        for x in cnt.values():\n            ans[x] += 1\n        ans[0] = (m - 1) * (n - 1) - len(cnt.values())\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["number-of-black-blocks"]}, "3308": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nGiven an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.

Here is a step-by-step guide to solving the problem of finding the k most frequent elements in an integer array:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Solving the Problem\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nYou need to find the k most frequent elements in an array. The frequency of an element refers to the number of times it appears in the array. You will return these k elements in any order.\n\n#### Step 2: Approach\nWe'll use the following approach to efficiently solve the problem:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**: Use a hash table (or dictionary) to count how many times each element appears in the array.\n2. **Keep Track of the Top k Elements**: Use a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the top k frequent elements. If at any point the heap size exceeds k, remove the least frequent element.\n3. **Output the Result**: Convert the elements in the heap to a list of results.\n\n#### Step 3: Implementing the Solution\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse the array and use a dictionary to count occurrences of each element.\n   - For instance, if the array is `[1,1,1,2,2,3]`, your dictionary will look like `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.\n\n2. **Using a Min Heap**:\n   - Use a min heap to store elements based on their frequency.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary and push each entry (element and its frequency) into the heap.\n   - Ensure the heap size does not exceed k. If it does, remove the smallest element (in terms of frequency).\n\n3. **Extract the k Most Frequent Elements**:\n   - Once all elements have been processed, extract the elements from the heap. These will be the k most frequent elements in the array.\n\n#### Step 4: Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize a Dictionary**:\n   - Create a dictionary to store frequencies of elements.\n   - Example: `cnt = {}`.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse each element in the array.\n   - For each element, if it is not present in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1. If it is present, increment its count.\n\n3. **Use a Min Heap**:\n   - Initialize a min heap.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary entries.\n   - For each entry, push it into the heap along with its frequency.\n   - If the heap size exceeds k, pop the smallest element.\n\n4. **Formulate the Result**:\n   - Extract elements from the heap.\n   - These will be your results.\n\n#### Step 5: Optimizations\n- **Time Complexity**: Using a hash table to count elements takes \\(O(n)\\) time, where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array.\n- **Heap Operations**: Inserting and removing from a heap of size k takes \\(O(\\log k)\\) time. Since we perform this for n elements, the time complexity for the heap operations is \\(O(n \\log k)\\).\n- **Space Complexity**: Space for storing counts in the dictionary is \\(O(n)\\). The heap space is \\(O(k)\\). Overall, space complexity is \\(O(n + k)\\).\n\n#### Step 6: Implementation Tips\n- Use the `collections.Counter` class in Python for easy frequency counting.\n- Use the `heapq` module for heap operations, which provides an efficient way to handle priority queues.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently solve the problem of finding the k most frequent elements in an array. Remember to write clean and readable code, and test your solution with various test cases to ensure its correctness.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n        cnt = Counter(nums)\n        return [x for x, _ in cnt.most_common(k)]\n", "problem_ids": ["top-k-frequent-elements"]}, "3309": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a 0-indexed string array words.\nLet's define a boolean function isPrefixAndSuffix that takes two strings, str1 and str2:\n\nisPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2) returns true if str1 is both a prefix and a suffix of str2, and false otherwise.\n\nFor example, isPrefixAndSuffix(\"aba\", \"ababa\") is true because \"aba\" is a prefix of \"ababa\" and also a suffix, but isPrefixAndSuffix(\"abc\", \"abcd\") is false.\nReturn an integer denoting the number of index pairs (i, j) such that i < j, and isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j]) is true.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"a\",\"aba\",\"ababa\",\"aa\"]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:\ni = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix(\"a\", \"aba\") is true.\ni = 0 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix(\"a\", \"ababa\") is true.\ni = 0 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix(\"a\", \"aa\") is true.\ni = 1 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix(\"aba\", \"ababa\") is true.\nTherefore, the answer is 4.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"pa\",\"papa\",\"ma\",\"mama\"]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:\ni = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix(\"pa\", \"papa\") is true.\ni = 2 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix(\"ma\", \"mama\") is true.\nTherefore, the answer is 2.  \nExample 3:\n\nInput: words = [\"abab\",\"ab\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this example, the only valid index pair is i = 0 and j = 1, and isPrefixAndSuffix(\"abab\", \"ab\") is false.\nTherefore, the answer is 0.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 105\n1 <= words[i].length <= 105\nwords[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.\nThe sum of the lengths of all words[i] does not exceed 5 * 105.\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Problem: Counting Prefix and Suffix Pairs\n\n#### Problem Understanding\nYou are given an array of strings called `words`, and you need to count how many pairs of indices `(i, j)` exist such that `i < j` and the string at index `i` is both a prefix and a suffix of the string at index `j`.\n\nTo clarify:\n- A prefix of a string is a substring starting from the beginning.\n- A suffix of a string is a substring ending at the end.\n\nFor example, for strings \"aba\" and \"ababa\":\n- \"aba\" is a prefix of \"ababa\".\n- \"aba\" is also a suffix of \"ababa\".\n\nTherefore, `(0, 2)` is a valid pair.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Step 1: Define the Helper Function\nFirst, define a helper function called `isPrefixAndSuffix` that takes two strings `str1` and `str2`.\n- The function should return `true` if `str1` is both a prefix and a suffix of `str2`.\n- Use string operations to check if `str2` starts with `str1` and ends with `str1`.\n\n#### Step 2: Iterate Over the Array\nFor each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i < j`, you need to check if `words[i]` satisfies being both a prefix and suffix of `words[j]`.\n- Iterate through the array with two nested loops.\n- The outer loop fixes the first string `words[i]`.\n- The inner loop explores all subsequent strings `words[j]` (where `j > i`).\n\n#### Step 3: Count Valid Pairs\nKeep a count of how many valid pairs you find using your `isPrefixAndSuffix` function.\n- Whenever the function returns `true`, increment your count.\n\n#### Step 4: Optimize Using Trie Data Structure (Advanced)\nIf the number of words or their lengths are substantial, the brute force method could be too slow. You can use a more advanced approach involving a Trie (prefix tree).\n\n1. **Trie Construction**: \n  - Store pairs of characters from each string.\n  - Specifically, store pairs of `(s[i], s[m - i - 1])`, which represent characters from the start and end of the string simultaneously.\n  \n2. **Node Definition**:\n  - Define a Trie `Node` class that will have a dictionary for its children and a counter.\n  \n3. **Trie Operation**:\n  - Iterate through each word, inserting it into the Trie.\n  - For each insertion operation, simultaneously count matching prefix-suffix pairs from previously inserted words by updating the count.\n\n### Step-by-Step Detailed Strategy\n\n#### 1. Define `isPrefixAndSuffix` Function\nThis function checks if one string is both a prefix and a suffix of another string:\n```python\ndef isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2):\n    if str2.startswith(str1) and str2.endswith(str1):\n        return True\n    return False\n```\n\n#### 2. Loop Through Array\n```python\ndef countPairs(words):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(words)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):\n            if isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j]):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n#### 3. Implement Advanced Solution Using Trie\nThis step involves a more sophisticated understanding of data structures, specifically Tries. Here's a high-level approach:\n\n- **Trie Node**: Create a Node class to store children and a counter.\n- **Trie Construction**: Build the Trie by iterating through character pairs as described.\n- **Count Matches While Inserting**: Each time you insert a string into the Trie, also check and count how many valid prefix-suffix pairs it completes with previous entries.\n\n#### Key Points to Remember:\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Check**: Ensure that your `isPrefixAndSuffix` function is correctly checking for both prefix and suffix conditions.\n2. **Efficiency**: The straightforward nested loop approach might become inefficient with larger inputs, hence the use of a Trie for optimization.\n3. **Complexity**: Understand the time complexity of both brute force (`O(n^2 * m)`) and the Trie-based method (`O(n * m)`), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the maximum length of the strings.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the problem efficiently and understand the underlying principles that make the solution work.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Node:\n    __slots__ = [\"children\", \"cnt\"]\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countPrefixSuffixPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:\n        ans = 0\n        trie = Node()\n        for s in words:\n            node = trie\n            for p in zip(s, reversed(s)):\n                if p not in node.children:\n                    node.children[p] = Node()\n                node = node.children[p]\n                ans += node.cnt\n            node.cnt += 1\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["count-prefix-and-suffix-pairs-ii"]}, "3311": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThere are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1.

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide for a student on how to solve this problem:\n\n---\n\n### Guide to Solve \"Chalk Replacer\" Problem\n\n#### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a class with `n` students, and each student is assigned a number from `0` to `n - 1`. Each student uses a certain number of chalk pieces to solve a problem, and this repeats in cycles starting again from student `0` once all have been given a problem. You are provided an array `chalk` where `chalk[i]` represents the number of chalk pieces student `i` uses. You also have `k` pieces of chalk initially. Your task is to determine the index of the student who will not have enough chalk to solve their problem and will thus need to replace the chalk.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Sum Up the Chalk Usage**:\n   - Calculate the total chalk usage per complete round among all students. This is found by summing all elements of the `chalk` array. Let's denote this sum by `s`.\n\n     Example: If `chalk = [3, 4, 1, 2]`, then `s = 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 10`.\n\n2. **Reduce the Chalk Amount**:\n   - Since the problem involves cyclic usage, you can reduce the initial chalk pieces, `k`, by modulo operation with the total sum `s`. This helps to determine the remaining chalk after full cycles.\n\n     Example: If `k = 25`, after performing modulo operation, `k %= 10` results in `k = 5`.\n\n3. **Simulate the Last Incomplete Round**:\n   - Now, simulate the process of each student solving their problem starting from student `0` again. Continue this until a student doesn't have enough chalk pieces to solve their problem.\n   - You begin with the current value of `k`, and for each student, check if `k` is less than `chalk[i]`. If `k` is less than `chalk[i]`, then this student will need to replace the chalk. Return the index `i` of this student.\n   - If `k` is sufficient, subtract `chalk[i]` from `k` and move to the next student.\n\n     Example:\n     - Start with `k = 5`.\n     - Student 0 uses 3 pieces, so you subtract 3 from 5, leaving `k = 2`.\n     - Next, student 1 needs 4 pieces, but you have only 2 pieces left (`k = 2`), so student 1 will be the one to replace the chalk.\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the total sum of the chalk array.\n2. **Modulo Operation**: Reduce `k` using modulo operation with the sum.\n3. **Simulation**: Iterate over the students, and for each:\n   - Check if the remaining chalk pieces are less than needed.\n   - If so, identify this student as the one to replace the chalk.\n   - Otherwise, deduct the used chalk and continue to the next student.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to identify which student will replace the chalk pieces in an efficient way considering cyclic student iterations.\n\n---\n\nBy understanding and applying these steps, you can solve the problem without needing to look at the explicit solution code. This method ensures clear logic and efficient process handling, crucial for solving similar problems in programming and algorithm design.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        s = sum(chalk)\n        k %= s\n        for i, x in enumerate(chalk):\n            if k < x:\n                return i\n            k -= x\n", "problem_ids": ["find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk"]}, "3312": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nThe string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)\n\nP   A   H   N\nA P L S I I G\nY   I   R\n\nAnd then read line by line: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\nWrite the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:\n\nstring convert(string s, int numRows);\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 3\nOutput: \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4\nOutput: \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\nExplanation:\nP     I    N\nA   L S  I G\nY A   H R\nP     I\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"A\", numRows = 1\nOutput: \"A\"\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.\n1 <= numRows <= 1000\n\n Solution: \n### Guide to Solving the Zigzag Pattern Conversion Problem\n\nTo solve the problem of converting a given string into a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows and then reading it line-by-line to form the final output, follow these detailed steps:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Understand the Zigzag Pattern:**\n   - The zigzag pattern involves writing characters in a diagonal fashion on a set number of rows and then reading the characters row-wise.\n   - For example, with the string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" and 3 rows, the pattern would look like this:\n     ```\n     P   A   H   N\n     A P L S I I G\n     Y   I   R\n     ```\n\n2. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the number of rows is 1, the output is the string itself because there is no zigzag pattern in a single row.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach:**\n   - Represent the zigzag structure using a list of lists (`g`). Each sublist will hold characters that belong to a specific row.\n   - Initialize variables:\n     - `i`: Tracks the current row index.\n     - `k`: A direction indicator (initially set to `-1` to represent upward movement).\n   - Traverse the string character by character. Append each character to the appropriate row in `g` based on the current value of `i`.\n\n4. **Direction Control:**\n   - Adjust the value of `i` and `k` to simulate the zigzag movement:\n     - If you are at the top row (`i == 0`) or the bottom row (`i == numRows - 1`), reverse the direction (`k = -k`).\n     - Update `i` by adding `k` (move up or down accordingly).\n\n5. **Collect the Result:**\n   - Once all characters have been added to the appropriate rows, concatenate all rows to form the final string by joining all sublists in `g`.\n\n#### Detailed Steps for Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a list of `numRows` empty lists (`g`).\n   - Set `i` to `0` (starting at the first row).\n   - Set `k` to `-1` (initial direction is upward).\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String:**\n   - For each character in the string:\n     - Append the character to the current row (`g[i]`).\n     - If you are at the first row (`i == 0`) or the last row (`i == numRows - 1`), multiply `k` by `-1` to change direction.\n     - Increment or decrement `i` by `k` to move to the next row accordingly.\n\n3. **Concatenate Rows:**\n   - After all characters are processed, each sublist in `g` contains the characters of a zigzag row.\n   - Combine all sublists into a single string and return this as the result.\n\n### Example to Clarify the Process\n\nLet's take an example to clarify:\n\n**Input:** `s = \"PAYPALISHIRING\", numRows = 4`\n\n1. **Pattern Formation:**\n\n   ```\n   P     I    N\n   A   L S  I G\n   Y A   H R\n   P     I\n   ```\n\n2. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Initialize `g` with 4 empty lists.\n   - Traverse the string and distribute characters according to the zigzag pattern:\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 0.\n     - Traverse \"A\", add to row 1.\n     - Traverse \"Y\", add to row 2.\n     - Traverse \"P\", add to row 3 (Reverse direction here).\n     - Continue following the described rules.\n\n3. **Result Compilation:**\n   - After processing all characters, concatenate the rows:\n     ```\n     P + I + N + A + L + S + I + G + Y + A + H + R + P + I  => \"PINALSIGYAHRPI\"\n     ```\n   - Return the concatenated string as the final output.\n\n### Summary\nBy systematically simulating the zigzag pattern, updating row indices, and reversing direction at appropriate points, you can effectively convert the given string to the required format and compile the final output. This approach handles edge cases and ensures an efficient solution.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:\n        if numRows == 1:\n            return s\n        g = [[] for _ in range(numRows)]\n        i, k = 0, -1\n        for c in s:\n            g[i].append(c)\n            if i == 0 or i == numRows - 1:\n                k = -k\n            i += k\n        return ''.join(chain(*g))\n", "problem_ids": ["zigzag-conversion"]}, "3317": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given a string s. s[i] is either a lowercase English letter or '?'.\nFor a string t having length m containing only lowercase English letters, we define the function cost(i) for an index i\u00a0as the number of characters equal to t[i]\u00a0that appeared before it, i.e. in the range [0, i - 1].\nThe value of t is the sum of cost(i) for all indices i.\nFor example, for the string t = \"aab\":\n\ncost(0) = 0\ncost(1) = 1\ncost(2) = 0\nHence, the value of \"aab\" is 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nYour task is to replace all occurrences of '?' in s with any lowercase English letter so that the value of s is minimized.\nReturn a string denoting the modified string with replaced occurrences of '?'.

Your task is to replace all '?' characters with the goal of minimizing the \"value\" of the resulting string. The value of a string is defined by a specific function that considers the number of times each character appears before a given position.\n\n#### Objective\n- Replace all '?' characters to form a new string that has the minimum possible value.\n- In case of multiple strings with the same minimum value, return the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Cost Function**:\n   - For a character `t[i]` in a resulting string, `cost(i)` is the number of times `t[i]` appeared before index `i`.\n   - The goal is to keep this cost as low as possible by distributing characters such that their appearances are minimized early in the string.\n\n2. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - **Greedy Approach with Frequency Tracking**: To achieve the smallest value, use a strategy where you track the frequency of each letter and ensure that those with the least frequency are used first to replace '?'. This method reduces the number of times any given character appears early in the string.\n   \n3. **Steps to Implement the Solution**:\n\n   - **Count Occurrences**:\n     - Count how often each lowercase letter appears in the string `s`.\n\n   - **Priority Queue**:\n     - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the letter with the minimum current frequency when replacing '?'.\n   \n   - **Replacement of '?'**:\n     - For each '?', use the character from the priority queue that has the least frequency. Update the frequency and place it back in the priority queue with its new frequency.\n   \n   - **Sorting for Lexicographical Order**:\n     - After replacing all '?', sort the replacements for two purposes: to ensure minimal value and to achieve lexicographical order in the case of ties.\n     \n   - **Construct the Final String**:\n     - Traverse the original string and replace '?' with the characters obtained from the sorted list.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Frequency Count**:\n   - Use a counter to count occurrences of each letter in `s`.\n\n2. **Prepare the Priority Queue**:\n   - Create a list of tuples consisting of the count of each letter (obtained from the counter) and the letter itself. This list will represent our priority queue.\n   - Convert this list into a min-heap.\n\n3. **Fill Replacement List**:\n   - Determine how many '?' characters need replacement.\n   - For each '?', extract the letter with the minimum frequency from the heap, append it to a list, increment its frequency, and push it back into the heap.\n\n4. **Sort Replacement Characters**:\n   - Sort this list of replacement characters to ensure lexicographical order.\n\n5. **Replace '?' in Original String**:\n   - Create a new list to build the final result string.\n   - Traverse the original string, and for each '?', replace it with the characters from the sorted replacement list.\n\n6. **Combine Results**:\n   - Join the list to form the final string and return it.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that all '?' are replaced in a way that minimizes the value of the string, while also adhering to lexicographical constraints when necessary.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n- **Input**: \"a?a?\"\n- **Steps**:\n   - Count frequencies: {'a': 2}\n   - Priority queue initially: `[(2, 'a'), (0, 'b'), (0, 'c'), ...]`\n   - Replace '?' characters with the least frequently occurring letters while updating counts, ensuring minimal initial repeats.\n   - Replace and sort: leads to the sequence being replaced with minimal repeats and then sorted lexographically.\n\nResult in: \"abac\" as the final output string.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def minimizeStringValue(self, s: str) -> str:\n        cnt = Counter(s)\n        pq = [(cnt[c], c) for c in ascii_lowercase]\n        heapify(pq)\n        t = []\n        for _ in range(s.count(\"?\")):\n            v, c = pq[0]\n            t.append(c)\n            heapreplace(pq, (v + 1, c))\n        t.sort()\n        cs = list(s)\n        j = 0\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\n            if c == \"?\":\n                cs[i] = t[j]\n                j += 1\n        return \"\".join(cs)\n", "problem_ids": ["replace-question-marks-in-string-to-minimize-its-value"]}, "3320": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls.

These boards direct balls either to the right or to the left. You will drop a ball into each column from the top, and your task is to determine where each ball will exit from the bottom, or whether it will get stuck.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the right spans the cell from the top-left to bottom-right and is represented as `1`.\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the left spans the cell from the top-right to bottom-left and is represented as `-1`.\n\n2. **Ball Movement and Stuck Conditions:**\n   - If the ball is redirected to the left at the leftmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If the ball is redirected to the right at the rightmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If adjacent cells form a 'V' shape (e.g., current cell is `1` with next cell to the right being `-1` or vice versa), the ball gets stuck.\n\n**Approach to Solution:**\n\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Simulation:**\n   - Create a DFS function to simulate the ball's movement from a given starting position.\n   - Use recursion to determine the ball's path as it moves down the grid.\n\n2. **Base Conditions for Ball Getting Stuck:**\n   - Check if the ball hits the box boundaries or a 'V' shape formed by adjacent boards.\n   - Return `-1` if any of these conditions are met.\n\n3. **Recursive Ball Movement:**\n   - If the ball moves correctly to the next row, recursively apply the DFS to the new position.\n   - When the ball reaches the last row, return the current column as the exit column.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Each Column:**\n   - For each column at the top, initiate the DFS and record the result.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialize Parameters:**\n   - Determine the number of rows `m` and columns `n` of the grid.\n\n2. **Define DFS Function:**\n   - The DFS function takes the current row and column as parameters.\n   - If the ball reaches the last row, return the current column.\n   - Check the following conditions for getting stuck:\n     - Ball tries to move left in the leftmost column, or right in the rightmost column.\n     - Adjacent cells form a 'V' shape.\n   - Recursively move the ball's position based on the board's direction.\n\n3. **Execute DFS for Each Column:**\n   - Iterate over each column at the top and use the DFS function to track the ball's final position or if it gets stuck.\n   - Store the result for each column in an answer list.\n\n4. **Output Results:**\n   - Return the list containing the exit columns or `-1` for each ball.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nConsider the grid:\n```\n[[ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1,  1,  1],\n [ 1,  1,  1,  1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]\n```\nEach ball will be dropped in each column. Using DFS:\n- Ball dropped at column 0 exits at column 1.\n- Ball dropped at column 1 gets stuck in a 'V' shape in columns 2 and 3 in the first or second row.\n- Repeat the process for each column.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nBy following the simulation approach with DFS and handling the boundary and 'V' shape conditions, you can determine the exit column of each ball or identify if it gets stuck.

Let's walk through the thought process and steps needed to solve this problem of partitioning the deck of cards.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nYou have a deck of cards represented by an integer array. Each element in the array represents a number written on a card. You need to partition the deck into one or more groups such that:\n1. Each group has exactly `x` cards, where `x` is greater than 1.\n2. All the cards in one group have the same integer.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether such a partition is possible.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences of Each Number:**\n   - First, we need to know how many times each number appears in the deck. This helps in determining whether we can form groups of the required size.\n\n2. **Use Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - To ensure that we can split the occurrences into groups of size `x` where `x` is greater than 1, we leverage the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The key idea here is that `x` must be a common divisor of the counts of all the numbers.\n   \n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Compute the GCD of the counts of all unique numbers in the deck. If this GCD is at least 2, you can form the groups as required.\n   \nNow, let's break this down into concrete steps:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - Use a dictionary (hash table) or an array to count how many times each number appears in the deck. For example, if your deck is `[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]`, the count would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Group Size Possibility Using GCD:**\n   - Next, use a method to calculate the GCD of these counts. For the counts `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`, the counts are `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The GCD of these values is 2.\n   - If the GCD is at least 2, then it is possible to partition the deck according to the rules provided. If GCD is less than 2, it's not possible.\n\n3. **Programming Approach:**\n   - In a programming context, you would typically use a `Counter` (from the collections library in Python) to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Then, you would use a function to compute the GCD of a list of numbers.\n   - Finally, you would check if this GCD is 2 or more to determine if partitioning is possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply these steps to an example:\n\n**Input: `deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]`**\n\n1. **Count the Frequencies:**\n   - `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}`\n\n2. **List of Counts:**\n   - `[3, 3, 2]`\n\n3. **Compute GCD:**\n   - GCD of `[3, 3, 2]` is 1\n\nSince GCD is 1, it's not possible to partition the deck as required.\n\n**Conclusion for this example:**\n- Output is `false`.\n\nFollowing the above guide, you should be able to conceptualize and implement the solution for this problem efficiently.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:\n        cnt = Counter(deck)\n        return reduce(gcd, cnt.values()) >= 2\n", "problem_ids": ["x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards"]}, "3329": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of size n consisting of non-empty strings.\nFind a string array answer of size n such that:\n\nanswer[i] is the shortest substring of arr[i] that does not occur as a substring in any other string in arr.

Here, \"unique\" means that the substring should not appear as a part of any other string in the given array. If multiple such substrings exist, you should select the one that is lexicographically smallest (i.e., dictionary order). If no such substring exists, you should return an empty string for that particular string.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem comprehensively:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**\n    - You have an array of strings.\n    - Your task is to find the shortest substring for each string in the array that does not occur in any other string in the array.\n    - If multiple shortest substrings exist, choose the smallest one based on lexicographical order.\n    - If no such substring exists, the answer for that string should be an empty string.\n\n2. **Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n    1. **Initialization:**\n        - Create a list named `ans` of the same length as the input array `arr`, initialized with empty strings. This list will store the required shortest unique substring for each corresponding string in `arr`.\n\n    2. **Enumerate Each String:**\n        - Loop over each string in the array `arr` using an index `i`. For each string `s`, determine its length `m`.\n\n    3. **Enumerate All Possible Substrings:**\n        - For a given string `s`, you need to enumerate all possible substrings. Start with the shortest possible substrings and gradually increase their length.\n        - Use two nested loops: one for the length of the substring (from 1 to the length of `s`), and the other for the starting position of the substring within `s`.\n\n    4. **Check Uniqueness:**\n        - For each substring, check if it appears in any other string in the array.\n        - If a substring does not exist in any other string and is either the first candidate or lexicographically smaller than the current candidate, update the answer for the current string `s`.\n        - If you find a valid substring for the current string, you can stop further checks for larger substrings.\n\n3. **Check Substring Existence:**\n    - For each substring, you need to ensure it doesn't appear in any other string within the array. This can be done using a generator expression or nested loops.\n\n4. **Final Return:**\n    - After processing all strings in the array, return the list `ans`, which now contains the shortest unique substrings for each string in the input array.\n\n### Detailed Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's go through an example with the input `arr = [\"cab\", \"ad\", \"bad\", \"c\"]`:\n\n- For the string \"cab\":\n    - Enumerate substrings starting with length 1: \"c\", \"a\", \"b\".\n    - \"c\" appears in \"c\", so it's not unique.\n    - \"a\" appears in \"ad\" and \"bad\", so it's not unique.\n    - \"b\" appears in \"bad\", so it's not unique.\n    - Increase substring length to 2: \"ca\", \"ab\".\n    - \"ca\" doesn't appear in any other string but \"ab\" is lexicographically smaller.\n    - \"ab\" is the shortest unique substring for \"cab\".\n\n- For the string \"ad\":\n    - Length 1: \"a\", \"d\".\n    - \"a\" appears in \"bad\" and \"cab\".\n    - \"d\" appears in \"bcd\".\n    - Length 2: \"ad\".\n    - \"ad\" appears in \"abcd\".\n    - No unique substring for \"ad\".\n\n- For the string \"bad\":\n    - Length 1: \"b\", \"a\", \"d\".\n    - All appear in other strings.\n    - Length 2: \"ba\", \"ad\".\n    - \"ba\" doesn't appear in any other string.\n    - \"ba\" is the shortest unique substring for \"bad\".\n\n- For the string \"c\":\n    - Length 1: \"c\" appears in \"cab\" and \"bcd\".\n    - No unique substring for \"c\".\n\nThe result array will be `[\"ab\", \"\", \"ba\", \"\"]`.\n\n### Key Concepts to Remember:\n\n- Enumerate substrings from shortest to longest.\n- Use nested loops to check each substring's existence in other strings.\n- Ensure the shortest and lexicographically smallest substring is selected.\n- Break the loop for a string once you find a valid substring.\n\nBy following these steps and logic, you will be able to solve the problem effectively.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubstrings(self, arr: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        ans = [\"\"] * len(arr)\n        for i, s in enumerate(arr):\n            m = len(s)\n            for j in range(1, m + 1):\n                for l in range(m - j + 1):\n                    sub = s[l : l + j]\n                    if not ans[i] or ans[i] > sub:\n                        if all(k == i or sub not in t for k, t in enumerate(arr)):\n                            ans[i] = sub\n                if ans[i]:\n                    break\n        return ans\n", "problem_ids": ["shortest-uncommon-substring-in-an-array"]}, "3331": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou are given an array arr of positive integers.

Each query specifies a range within the array, and your task is to compute the XOR of all elements within that range. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n1. **XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation applied to two integers. When applied to binary digits:\n   - 0 XOR 0 = 0\n   - 1 XOR 0 = 1\n   - 0 XOR 1 = 1\n   - 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n   For example, the XOR of integers 3 (0011) and 5 (0101) is 6 (0110).\n\n2. **Prefix XOR Array**: This is a handy technique where we precompute the XOR of elements up to each position in the array. The prefix XOR array at position `i` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n\n#### Why Use a Prefix XOR Array?\n1. **Efficiency**: Directly computing the XOR for each query could be slow if the array or the number of queries is large. Instead, we can preprocess the array to speed up the query resolution.\n2. **Query Simplification**: Once we have the prefix XOR array, each query that asks for the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be computed quickly using two entries from this array.\n\n#### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Initialize the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Create an array `prefixXOR` such that:\n     - `prefixXOR[0] = 0` (optional starting point to handle the cumulative XOR easily).\n     - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1` in the original array.\n\n2. **Populate the Prefix XOR Array**:\n   - Iterate through the original array and fill in the `prefixXOR` array.\n     Example: \n     - If `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, then:\n       - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n       - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2`\n       - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 XOR 4 = 6`\n       - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 XOR 8 = 14`\n\n3. **Process Each Query**:\n   - For a given query `[left, right]`, the XOR of elements from `left` to `right` can be found using:\n     - `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`\n\n#### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's apply this to an example:\n\n- Array: `[1, 3, 4, 8]`\n- Queries: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`\n\n1. **Build Prefix XOR Array**:\n    - `prefixXOR[0] = 0`\n    - `prefixXOR[1] = 1`\n    - `prefixXOR[2] = 1 ^ 3 = 2`\n    - `prefixXOR[3] = 2 ^ 4 = 6`\n    - `prefixXOR[4] = 6 ^ 8 = 14`\n\n2. **Answer Queries**:\n    - For query `[0, 1]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[2] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`\n    - For query `[1, 2]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[3] ^ prefixXOR[1] = 6 ^ 1 = 7`\n    - For query `[0, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[0] = 14 ^ 0 = 14`\n    - For query `[3, 3]`:\n      - Answer: `prefixXOR[4] ^ prefixXOR[3] = 14 ^ 6 = 8`\n\n#### Summary\n\n1. Create a prefix XOR array to store the cumulative XORs up to each position in the array.\n2. For each query, use the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the result using the formula: `prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left]`.\n3. This approach ensures that each query is resolved in constant time after an initial pass through the array to build the prefix XOR array.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve the XOR query problem efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        s = list(accumulate(arr, xor, initial=0))\n        return [s[r + 1] ^ s[l] for l, r in queries]\n", "problem_ids": ["xor-queries-of-a-subarray"]}, "3347": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem_description: \nYou have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls.

These boards direct balls either to the right or to the left. You will drop a ball into each column from the top, and your task is to determine where each ball will exit from the bottom, or whether it will get stuck.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the right spans the cell from the top-left to bottom-right and is represented as `1`.\n   - A board that redirects a ball to the left spans the cell from the top-right to bottom-left and is represented as `-1`.\n\n2. **Ball Movement and Stuck Conditions:**\n   - If the ball is redirected to the left at the leftmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If the ball is redirected to the right at the rightmost column, it gets stuck.\n   - If adjacent cells form a 'V' shape (e.g., current cell is `1` with next cell to the right being `-1` or vice versa), the ball gets stuck.\n\n**Approach to Solution:**\n\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Simulation:**\n   - Create a DFS function to simulate the ball's movement from a given starting position.\n   - Use recursion to determine the ball's path as it moves down the grid.\n\n2. **Base Conditions for Ball Getting Stuck:**\n   - Check if the ball hits the box boundaries or a 'V' shape formed by adjacent boards.\n   - Return `-1` if any of these conditions are met.\n\n3. **Recursive Ball Movement:**\n   - If the ball moves correctly to the next row, recursively apply the DFS to the new position.\n   - When the ball reaches the last row, return the current column as the exit column.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Each Column:**\n   - For each column at the top, initiate the DFS and record the result.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialize Parameters:**\n   - Determine the number of rows `m` and columns `n` of the grid.\n\n2. **Define DFS Function:**\n   - The DFS function takes the current row and column as parameters.\n   - If the ball reaches the last row, return the current column.\n   - Check the following conditions for getting stuck:\n     - Ball tries to move left in the leftmost column, or right in the rightmost column.\n     - Adjacent cells form a 'V' shape.\n   - Recursively move the ball's position based on the board's direction.\n\n3. **Execute DFS for Each Column:**\n   - Iterate over each column at the top and use the DFS function to track the ball's final position or if it gets stuck.\n   - Store the result for each column in an answer list.\n\n4. **Output Results:**\n   - Return the list containing the exit columns or `-1` for each ball.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nConsider the grid:\n```\n[[ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [ 1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1,  1,  1],\n [ 1,  1,  1,  1, -1],\n [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]\n```\nEach ball will be dropped in each column. Using DFS:\n- Ball dropped at column 0 exits at column 1.\n- Ball dropped at column 1 gets stuck in a 'V' shape in columns 2 and 3 in the first or second row.\n- Repeat the process for each column.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nBy following the simulation approach with DFS and handling the boundary and 'V' shape conditions, you can determine the exit column of each ball or identify if it gets stuck. This approach ensures that you comprehensively track the ball's journey through the grid.\n\n Solution Code: \nclass Solution:\n    def findBall(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:\n            if i == m:\n                return j\n            if j == 0 and grid[i][j] == -1:\n                return -1\n            if j == n - 1 and grid[i][j] == 1:\n                return -1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == -1:\n                return -1\n            if grid[i][j] == -1 and grid[i][j - 1] == 1:\n                return -1\n            return dfs(i + 1, j + 1) if grid[i][j] == 1 else dfs(i + 1, j - 1)\n\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        return [dfs(0, j) for j in range(n)]\n", "problem_ids": ["where-will-the-ball-fall"]}, "1873_A": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1873_B": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1873_D": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1883_B": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1883_C": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1899_A": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1899_B": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1899_C": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "1899_D": {"text": "", "problem_ids": []}, "abc301_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nTakahashi and Aoki are playing a game using \\(N\\) cards.

It is a good string, and \n2. Its last \\(\\min\\lbrace K-1,|T|\\rbrace\\) characters coincide with \\(P\\).\n\nFor a string \\(T\\) consisting of A, B, and ?, suppose that \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T[P]\\) is known for all possible \\(P\\).\nThen, if \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{A}}[P]\\) and \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{B}}[P],\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{?}}[P]\\) can be found fast, then the problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. (Here, the string \\(X\\) succeeded by a character \\(c\\) is denoted by \\(X+c\\)).\n\nLet us consider an algorithm to find \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt A}\\) from \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T\\).

Given \\(k\\) coins \\((r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)\\), one can determine if there is a path that can collect all the coins as follows:\n\nSort the coins in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Here, \\((r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j) \\Leftrightarrow (r_i < r_j) \\lor (r_i = r_j \\land c_i < c_j)\\). Let \\(((r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k))\\) be the resulting sequence. There exists a path that can collect all the given \\(k\\) coins if and only if \\(c'_1 \\leq c'_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq c'_k\\).\n\nProof: If two coins $i$ and $j$ with $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$ are to be collected, coin $i$ has to be collected first. Thus, the $k$ coins $(r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)$ can be all collected if and only if the $k$ coins $(r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k)$ can be collected **in this order**. Given $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$, we have $(r_i \\leq r_j \\land c_i \\leq c_j) \\Leftrightarrow c_i \\leq c_j$, so the claim above has been shown.\n\nSuppose that the given \\(N\\) coins are sorted in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Then, by the fact above, this problem is boiled down to finding a longest (weakly) increasing subsequence (LIS). Given positive integer sequence \\(c=(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_N)\\), one can find the length of a LIS of \\(c\\) (not its length) by the following famous algorithm:\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\). Do the following for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\).\n\nFor the minimum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j > c_i\\), replace \\(d_j\\) with \\(c_i\\). The length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\).\n\nIntuitively, each \\(d_j\\) manages the smallest last element of a length-\\(j\\) (weakly) increasing subsequence of \\(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_i\\) (or \\(\\infty\\) if there is no such subsequence). To find an example of LIS instead of its length only, let us modify the algorithm as follows.\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\). Prepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(\\text{id}\\) and \\(\\text{pre}\\). Do the following for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\).\n\nFor the minimum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j > c_i\\), replace \\(d_j\\) with \\(c_i\\), and replace \\(\\text{id}_j\\) with \\(i\\). If \\(j > 1\\), replace \\(\\text{pre}_i\\) with \\(\\text{id}_{j-1}\\) too.\n\nThe length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\). Let \\(l\\) be the length of a LIS of \\(c\\). Consider a length-\\(l\\) sequence obtained by applying \\((l-1)\\) times the action \\(i\\mapsto \\text{pre}_i\\) to \\(\\text{id}_l\\), namely \\((\\text{id}_l, \\text{pre}_{\\text{id}_l},\\text{pre}_{\\text{pre}_{\\text{id}_l}},\\dots)\\).

In general, at most three length-\\(3\\) substrings will change. Therefore, it is sufficient to inspect only three substrings that possibly changes, count the number of ABC before and after modifications, and find the answer after the modification based on the difference and the count before the modification.

He can combine these styles to swim by consuming stamina of \\(tA_1+(1-t)A_2\\) to advance \\(tB_1+(1-t)B_2\\) meters per second. This corresponds to points on the segment connecting \\((B_1,A_1)\\) and \\((B_2,A_2)\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\nIf there are \\(N\\) points \\((B_i,A_i)\\), he can swim for any point inside or on the convex hull's boundary, but not outside it. Plotting the styles on the \\(xy\\)-plane assists in this determination. The most time-efficient point has the maximum \\(B_i\\), and the most stamina-efficient point has the minimum \\(A_i/B_i\\). If he can't swim \\(D_i\\) meters using the stamina-efficient point, the answer is -1.\n\nTo swim \\(D_i\\) meters within stamina \\(C_i\\), locate the rightmost point in the intersection of the convex hull's circumference and a line passing through \\((0,0)\\) and \\((D_i,C_i)\\). This represents viable swimming styles under the stamina constraint. He should trace the convex hull from the stamina-efficient point to the time-efficient point counterclockwise. Using binary search helps identify which segment it lies on and then pinpoints \\(P_{opt}\\)'s exact coordinates.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc356_g"]}, "abc302_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given two permutations \\( P = (P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_N) \\) and \\( Q = (Q_1, Q_2, \\dots, Q_N) \\) of \\( (1, 2, \\dots, N) \\).\n\nWrite one of the characters '0' and '1' in each cell of an \\( N \\)-by-\\( N \\) grid so that all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc302_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou have an undirected graph with \\( N \\) vertices and initially, it has 0 edges.

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc303_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 300 points\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are playing a game.

We will perform operation 1 as needed and consider the following operations:\n\nOperation A: When the piece and the gate are on the same vertex, move both the piece and the gate to an adjacent vertex. Operation B: Move the piece to an adjacent vertex. Operation C: Move the piece to the vertex where the gate is located.\n\nOperations A and B each incur a cost of 1. Once operation B is performed, the gate remains in its position until operation C is performed. It's inefficient to move the piece to the gate using operation B, so we will not consider this.\n\nLet \\(v\\) be the initial position of the piece and gate. By performing operation C at the end, the process ends when the piece and the gate are on the same vertex. Label the vertices and edges the gate moves to with A, and the rest with B. The vertices and edges labeled A form a connected subgraph, or subtree A. Vertex \\(v\\) is included in subtree A. Edges labeled B with one endpoint as A are boundary edges.\n\nVertices and edges labeled B not connected to boundary edges form connected components. Each component is a tree connected to a vertex in subtree A by a boundary edge \\(e_i\\). Let them form subtree \\(B_i\\), connected to vertex \\(l_i\\) in A.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. In optimal operations, assume edges labeled A are not traversed by operation B. By rearranging operations, the cost does not increase:\n\n   - The piece and gate start from \\(v\\), visit all vertices in A using operation A, and return to \\(v\\). This is the journey in A.\n   - If \\(l_i\\) is visited during A's journey, it's interrupted. The piece starts from \\(l_i\\), visits all vertices in \\(B_i\\) using operation B, and returns to \\(l_i\\). This is the journey in \\(B_i\\). The gate stays at \\(l_i\\).\n\n2. Assume moving along boundary edge \\(e_i\\) occurs only once in B's journey. If done more than once, moving with the gate using operation A during the first move and returning does not increase the cost. In \\(B_i\\)'s journey, operation C is done once at the end.\n\n3. In the journeys of A and \\(B_i\\), the farthest vertex is visited last. If the distance from start to the farthest vertex is \\(d\\) and the number of edges is \\(m\\), the cost is \\(2m - d\\).\n\nThe total number of edges in subtrees is \\(N-1\\). Minimize cost by maximizing \\(d\\)'s total sum. Calculate for fixed \\(v\\) using tree DP. Maintain:\n\n- Maximum distance to vertex where \\(B_i\\)'s journey ends, assuming \\(u = l_i\\).\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex not in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n\nExtend to rerooting DP to examine all possible starting vertices.

If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc304_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere is a circular cake divided into \\(N\\) pieces by cut lines.

If possible, how many cut lines are never used by any division among such ways?\n\nFor each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq N\\), let us consider whether there exists a conforming division that uses cut line \\(i\\).

Given \\(k\\) coins \\((r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)\\), one can determine if there is a path that can collect all the coins as follows:\n\nSort the coins in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Here, \\((r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j) \\Leftrightarrow (r_i < r_j) \\lor (r_i = r_j \\land c_i < c_j)\\). Let \\(((r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k))\\) be the resulting sequence. There exists a path that can collect all the given \\(k\\) coins if and only if \\(c'_1 \\leq c'_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq c'_k\\).\n\nProof: If two coins $i$ and $j$ with $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$ are to be collected, coin $i$ has to be collected first. Thus, the $k$ coins $(r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),\\dots,(r_k,c_k)$ can be all collected if and only if the $k$ coins $(r'_1,c'_1),(r'_2,c'_2),\\dots,(r'_k,c'_k)$ can be collected **in this order**. Given $(r_i, c_i) < (r_j, c_j)$, we have $(r_i \\leq r_j \\land c_i \\leq c_j) \\Leftrightarrow c_i \\leq c_j$, so the claim above has been shown.\n\nSuppose that the given \\(N\\) coins are sorted in ascending order of \\((r,c)\\). Then, by the fact above, this problem is boiled down to finding a longest (weakly) increasing subsequence (LIS). Given positive integer sequence \\(c=(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_N)\\), one can find the length of a LIS of \\(c\\) (not its length) by the following famous algorithm:\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\).

The length of a LIS of \\(c\\) is the maximum \\(j\\) with \\(d_j < \\infty\\).\n\nIntuitively, each \\(d_j\\) manages the smallest last element of a length-\\(j\\) (weakly) increasing subsequence of \\(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_i\\) (or \\(\\infty\\) if there is no such subsequence). To find an example of LIS instead of its length only, let us modify the algorithm as follows.\n\nPrepare a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(d\\) initialized with \\(\\infty\\).

On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved.

The time complexity is \\(O(NK)\\) due to the bit-reversal calculation being the bottleneck.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n\n    def bit_reversal(x):\n        return int(bin(x)[2:].zfill(K - 1)[::-1], 2)\n\n    if N >= 2 ** (K - 1):\n        print(*[max(1, 2**K - i - 1) for i in range(N)])\n    else:\n        print(*[2 ** (K - 1) + bit_reversal(i) for i in range(N)])\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also solve it by constructing from the highest bit downwards.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    C = [1]\n    for _ in range(1, K):\n        D = [2 * c for c in C] + [2 * c + 1 for c in C]\n        C = D[:N]\n    while len(C) < N:\n        C.append(1)\n    print(*C)\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc182_b"]}, "abc306_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n## Problem Statement\nYou are given positive integers \\(N\\) and \\(K\\).\n\nAn integer sequence of length \\(NK\\) is called a **good** integer sequence if each integer from \\(1\\) to \\(N\\) appears exactly \\(K\\) times in the sequence.\n\nLet \\(S\\) be the number of good integer sequences.

Thus, one can solve this problem by counting for each of the eight \\(1 \\times 1\\) squares how many instances of them are contained in the given rectangle. In order to count the number of squares at each position, it may be difficult to handle boundaries. As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\). Do the same thing for the \\(y\\) axis.\n\nAlso, when debugging this type of problem, it is effective to generate cases by yourself. In this problem, if it is a boundary issue that matters, it is a good idea to try many cases for \\(0 \\leq A, B, C, D \\leq 8\\).\n\nSample code (Python):\n```python\nmass = [[2, 1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 2, 1, 0]]\n# mass[i][j] : area of rectangle [[j, j + 1], [i, i + 1]] x 2\n\ninf = 4000000000\n\n# input\na, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n\n# calculation\nans = 0\nfor fy in range(2):\n    for fx in range(4):\n        x1 = (a - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        x2 = (c - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        count_x = x2 - x1  # count along x axis\n        y1 = (b - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        y2 = (d - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        count_y = y2 - y1  # count along y axis\n        ans += count_x * count_y * mass[fy][fx]\n\n# output\nprint(ans)\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc354_d"]}, "abc307_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 350 points\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a string \\( S \\) of length \\( N \\).

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc308_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThere is an integer sequence \\( S \\) of length \\( N \\).

If there is no contradiction, the answer is at least \\(1\\). This is because, for any operation, the direction is set so that it can be performed after the previous operations.

Draw a sock of color 1 from the chest. There remains one sock of color 1 and two socks of color 2 in the chest.\n2. Draw a sock of color 2 from the chest. There remains one sock each of colors 1 and 2 in the chest.\n3. Draw a sock of color 1 from the chest. The socks drawn so far are two of color 1 and one of color 2, allowing a pair of color 1 socks to be made, thus ending the operation.\n\nIn this example, Takahashi draws a sock from the chest three times. The expected number of times Takahashi draws a sock from the chest is 3 with probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) and 2 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), so the expected value is \\( 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} \\equiv 665496238 \\pmod{998244353} \\).\n\n**Sample Input 2:**\n```\n1\n352\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2:**\n```\n2\n```\n\n**Sample Input 3:**\n```\n6\n1796 905 2768 253 2713 1448\n```\n\n**Sample Output 3:**\n```\n887165507\n```\n\nSolution:\n\n        Here is the cleaned version of the editorial content without extraneous information:\n\n---\n\nLet \\(S = A_1 + A_2 + \\dots + A_N\\). By the Pigeonhole Theorem, Takahashi draws a sock at most \\(N+1\\) times. Let \\(P_i\\) be the probability that he draws a sock at least \\(i\\) times. The expected value is \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\nLet \\(Q_i\\) be the probability that he draws a sock exactly \\(i\\) times. The expected value is \\(1 \\cdot Q_1 + 2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\dots + (N+1) \\cdot Q_{N+1}\\). Using \\(Q_i = P_i - P_{i+1}\\), this can be rewritten as \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\n\\(P_{i+1}\\) is equivalent to the probability that there is no duplicating color after drawing \\(i\\) socks. Denote \\(f_i\\) as the number of ways to choose \\(i\\) socks with different colors among the \\(S\\) socks: \\(P_{i+1} = \\frac{f_i}{\\binom{S}{i}}\\). Finding \\(\\binom{S}{0}, \\binom{S}{1}, \\dots, \\binom{S}{N}\\) is trivial, so the task is to find \\(f_i\\).\n\nDefine a polynomial \\(F = \\sum_{i=0}^{S} f_i x^i\\). Since \\(f_i = \\sum_{1 \\leq k_1 < k_2 < \\dots < k_i \\leq N} \\prod_{l=1}^{i} A_{k_l}\\), \\(F\\) is the total product of \\(F_1, F_2, \\dots, F_N\\), where \\(F_i = (1 + A_i x)\\). The problem reduces to:\n\nGiven \\(N\\) linear polynomials, find their product.\n\nThis can be solved with a divide-and-conquer algorithm in \\(O(N\\log^2 N)\\) time. Specifically, define \\(f(l,r)\\) as the product of \\(F_l, F_{l+1}, \\dots, F_{r-1}\\), and apply \\(f(l,r) = f(l,m) \\times f(m,r)\\ (m = \\lfloor\\frac{l+r}{2}\\rfloor)\\) to evaluate it recursively.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc308_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThere is a grid with \\( N \\) rows and \\( N \\) columns.

As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\).

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\).

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc310_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 350 points\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nA souvenir shop at AtCoder Land sells \\(N\\) boxes.

We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem. The time complexity is \\(O(NK)\\) due to the bit-reversal calculation being the bottleneck.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n\n    def bit_reversal(x):\n        return int(bin(x)[2:].zfill(K - 1)[::-1], 2)\n\n    if N >= 2 ** (K - 1):\n        print(*[max(1, 2**K - i - 1) for i in range(N)])\n    else:\n        print(*[2 ** (K - 1) + bit_reversal(i) for i in range(N)])\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also solve it by constructing from the highest bit downwards.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    C = [1]\n    for _ in range(1, K):\n        D = [2 * c for c in C] + [2 * c + 1 for c in C]\n        C = D[:N]\n    while len(C) < N:\n        C.append(1)\n    print(*C)\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc182_b"]}, "abc310_f": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nTakahashi has various colors of socks in his chest of drawers.

Once a sock is drawn, it will not be returned to the chest.\n\nFind the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the number of times he has to draw a sock from the chest.\n\nIt can be proved that the sought expected value is always rational. Furthermore, the constraints of this problem guarantee that if the expected value is expressed as an irreducible fraction \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), then \\( x \\) is not divisible by 998244353.

There remains one sock each of colors 1 and 2 in the chest.\n3. Draw a sock of color 1 from the chest. The socks drawn so far are two of color 1 and one of color 2, allowing a pair of color 1 socks to be made, thus ending the operation.\n\nIn this example, Takahashi draws a sock from the chest three times.

By the Pigeonhole Theorem, Takahashi draws a sock at most \\(N+1\\) times. Let \\(P_i\\) be the probability that he draws a sock at least \\(i\\) times. The expected value is \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\nLet \\(Q_i\\) be the probability that he draws a sock exactly \\(i\\) times. The expected value is \\(1 \\cdot Q_1 + 2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\dots + (N+1) \\cdot Q_{N+1}\\). Using \\(Q_i = P_i - P_{i+1}\\), this can be rewritten as \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\n\\(P_{i+1}\\) is equivalent to the probability that there is no duplicating color after drawing \\(i\\) socks. Denote \\(f_i\\) as the number of ways to choose \\(i\\) socks with different colors among the \\(S\\) socks: \\(P_{i+1} = \\frac{f_i}{\\binom{S}{i}}\\). Finding \\(\\binom{S}{0}, \\binom{S}{1}, \\dots, \\binom{S}{N}\\) is trivial, so the task is to find \\(f_i\\).\n\nDefine a polynomial \\(F = \\sum_{i=0}^{S} f_i x^i\\).

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

It is a good string, and \n2. Its last \\(\\min\\lbrace K-1,|T|\\rbrace\\) characters coincide with \\(P\\).\n\nFor a string \\(T\\) consisting of A, B, and ?, suppose that \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T[P]\\) is known for all possible \\(P\\).\nThen, if \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{A}}[P]\\) and \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{B}}[P],\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{?}}[P]\\) can be found fast, then the problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. (Here, the string \\(X\\) succeeded by a character \\(c\\) is denoted by \\(X+c\\)).\n\nLet us consider an algorithm to find \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt A}\\) from \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T\\).

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc313_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n---\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a directed graph with \\( N \\) vertices and \\( M \\) edges.

It is possible to turn \\(A\\) into a good sequence through operations.\n\nProof: If we can make \\(A\\) into a good sequence, then \\(A\\) can be made into a non-decreasing sequence. Suppose we transform \\(A\\) into a non-decreasing sequence. After that, we can perform operations to transform \\(A\\) into a good sequence:\n\nInvariant: Initially, the sequence \\((A_1)\\) is a good sequence, and \\(A\\) is non-decreasing. For \\(i = 2, 3, \\dots, N\\), do the following:\n\nInvariant: \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1})\\) is a good sequence. While \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) is not a good sequence, find exactly one position \\(j\\) \\((1 \\leq j \\leq i-1)\\) where adding \\(1\\) to \\(A_j\\) maintains \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1})\\) as a good sequence. Perform the operation on \\((j, i)\\).\n\nRepeat the operation until \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) becomes a good sequence. \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) becomes a good sequence if \\(A_{i-1}\\) and \\(A_i\\) coincide, reducing the difference by \\(1\\) or \\(2\\). If it is not obtained, choosing \\(j = i - 1\\) when the difference is \\(1\\) results in \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{i-1}, A_i) = (x, x, \\dots, x, x+1)\\), which is a good sequence, so no operation is performed.\n\nAfter the operation, \\((A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i)\\) is a good sequence, and \\(A_i \\leq A_{i+1}\\), so \\(A\\) remains non-decreasing.\n\nThus, the two propositions are equivalent.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc314_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given a string \\( S \\) of length \\( N \\) consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.

Since there are \\(10\\) counterfeit coins, any group of \\(11\\) or more coins of the same type must be genuine.\n\nConsider dividing the \\(1000\\) coins into groups of \\(11\\). There will be \\(90\\) groups of \\(11\\) coins and a remainder of \\(10\\) coins. Among these \\(90\\) groups, at most \\(10\\) groups may contain counterfeit coins, so we can obtain at least \\(80\\) groups of \\(11\\) coins that are all of the same type. Also, we need \\(10\\) inspections to divide a group of \\(11\\) coins into two types (without knowing which is genuine).\n\nFirst, use \\(900\\) inspections to divide all the \\(11\\)-coin groups into two types. Next, exclude the coins that have been identified as genuine (where all \\(11\\) coins are of the same type). Record one coin number \\(x\\) identified as genuine. We have up to \\(20\\) groups of coins whose type is undetermined, and the \\(10\\) leftover coins. Using up to an additional \\(30\\) inspections, determine whether each remaining coin is of the same type as \\(x\\) to identify all counterfeit coins. This solution can identify all counterfeit coins using a maximum of \\(930\\) inspections.\n\nSample Implementation (Python 3):\n```python\ndef ask(x, y):\n    print(f\"? {x} {y}\")\n    # Assume here that we get a response from the interaction\n    res = int(input().strip())\n    return res\n\ndef ans(a):\n    print(\"!\", \" \".join(map(str, a)))\n\ndef main():\n    n, m, q = map(int, input().split())  # dummy input\n    ok = None\n    unknown = []\n    for i in range(90):\n        up = i * 11 + 1\n        g1 = [up]\n        g2 = []\n        for j in range(i * 11 + 2, i * 11 + 12):\n            if ask(up, j) == 0:\n                g1.append(j)\n            else:\n                g2.append(j)\n        if not g2:\n            ok = up\n        else:\n            unknown.append(g1)\n            unknown.append(g2)\n    for i in range(991, 1001):\n        unknown.append([i])\n    res = []\n    for nx in unknown:\n        if ask(nx[0], ok) == 1:\n            res.extend(nx)\n    ans(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc184_a"]}, "abc315_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere is a grid with \\( H \\) rows and \\( W \\) columns.

First, the integer \\( N \\) is given.\n2. Perform a comparison between \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\). The judge returns 1 because \\( X_1 < X_2 \\) (-1 < 10).\n3. Perform an addition of \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_3 \\). The judge erases \\( X_1 = -1 \\) and \\( X_3 = 1 \\) from the blackboard and writes \\( X_1 + X_3 = 0 \\). This is the fourth integer written.\n4. Perform an addition of \\( X_2 \\) and \\( X_4 \\). The judge erases \\( X_2 = 10 \\) and \\( X_4 = 0 \\) from the blackboard and writes \\( X_2 + X_4 = 10 \\). This is the fifth integer written.\n5. The blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\), so report this to the judge.\n\nSolution:\n\nBelow is the editorial as provided, since there's no code to translate to Python3:\n\n```\nAtCoder Regular Contest 179 - C: Beware of Overflow Editorial\n\nTo have only one integer on the blackboard, we need to perform exactly \\(N-1\\) additions. When there are two or more integers left on the blackboard, we should add the maximum and minimum values. The absolute value of their sum does not exceed \\(R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the multiset of integers on the blackboard, with maximum \\(M\\) and minimum \\(m\\). The absolute value of every element in \\(X\\) is at most \\(R\\), and \\(\\displaystyle\\left|\\sum_{x\\in X}x\\right|\\leq R\\).\n\n1. If \\(m \\geq 0\\), all integers are non-negative: \\(0 \\leq m + M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n2. If \\(M \\leq 0\\), all integers are non-positive: \\(0 \\geq m + M \\geq -R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n3. If \\(m \\leq 0\\) and \\(M \\geq 0\\), \\(-R \\leq m \\leq m + M \\leq M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n\nWe should add the maximum and minimum values. Use merge sort to arrange values in ascending order. Perform addition interactions to add the minimum and maximum values. Remove the first and last elements and insert the sum. Binary search determines the insertion position.\n\nEstimate interactions: Merge sort on a list of length \\(2^n\\) requires at most \\(a_n = n2^n\\) comparisons. Under \\(N \\leq 1000 \\leq 2^{10}\\), at most 10240 comparisons are needed. Finding insertion positions requires at most \\(10 \\times (N-1) \\leq 9990\\) comparisons. In total, at most 20230 comparisons plus \\(N-1 \\leq 999\\) additions remain well within the limit of 25000 interactions.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc179_c"]}, "abc315_f": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nIn the AtCoder World Tour Finals 2800, `N` contestants participated, and a total of five problems were presented.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc318_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 550 points\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nYou are given a weighted undirected connected graph \\( G \\) with \\( N \\) vertices and \\( N-1 \\) edges, where vertices are numbered from \\( 1 \\) to \\( N \\) and edges are numbered from \\( 1 \\) to \\( N-1 \\).

Let \\(G_k (0\\leq k\\leq W)\\) be the (unweighted) subgraph of \\(G\\) consisting of the edges of \\(G\\) with weights not more than \\(k\\). Let \\(H\\) be the number of connected components of a graph \\(H\\), then the sum of weights of edges in an MST of graph \\(G\\) equals \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{W-1}\\left( c(G_k)-1\\right)\\).\n\n**(Proof) Approach 1:** Among the edges in an MST of \\(G\\), there are \\(N-c(G_k)\\) edges whose weight is not greater than \\(k\\). Therefore, there are \\(\\left(N-c(G_k)\\right)-\\left(N-c(G_{k-1})\\right)=c(G_{k-1})-c(G_k)\\) edges whose weight is exactly \\(k\\), so the total edge weight in an MST of graph \\(G\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{W}k\\left(c(G_{k-1})-c(G_k)\\right)=\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{W-1}\\left( c(G_k)\\right)-W\\cdot c(G_W)=\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{W-1}\\left( c(G_k)-1\\right)\\).\n\n**(Approach 2):** Among the edges in an MST of \\(G\\), there are \\(c(G_{k-1})-1\\) edges whose weight is not greater than \\(c(G_{k-1})-1\\). Thus, the total edge weight in an MST of graph \\(G\\) is \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{W}\\left(c(G_{k-1})-1\\right)=\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{W-1}\\left(c(G_k)-1\\right)\\).\n\nFor each \\(k(0\\leq k\\lt W)\\), one can manage the number of connected components of \\(G_k\\) with a disjoint set union (DSU) to solve this problem in a total of \\(O(W(N+Q)\\alpha(N))\\).

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).

Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\).

The last large tile is also limited to four candidates, and the toll required to reach from each large tile to \\((T _ x+0.5,T _ y+0.5)\\) as well. For these at most \\(16\\) pairs, it is sufficient to find the minimum toll required to travel between large tiles. One can use pruning to reduce pairs, but it is fast enough without it.\n\nWe consider how to find the minimum toll required to travel between two tiles. First, one can travel between two large tiles sharing a vertex for a toll of \\(2\\). Also, one can travel between a large tile \\([i,i+K]\\times[j,j+K]\\) and another \\([i+K,i+2K]\\times[j,j+K]\\) for a toll of \\(K=2\\), which must be considered only for \\(K=2\\).

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem.

There will be \\(90\\) groups of \\(11\\) coins and a remainder of \\(10\\) coins.

It is a good string, and \n2. Its last \\(\\min\\lbrace K-1,|T|\\rbrace\\) characters coincide with \\(P\\).\n\nFor a string \\(T\\) consisting of A, B, and ?, suppose that \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T[P]\\) is known for all possible \\(P\\).\nThen, if \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{A}}[P]\\) and \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{B}}[P],\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt{?}}[P]\\) can be found fast, then the problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. (Here, the string \\(X\\) succeeded by a character \\(c\\) is denoted by \\(X+c\\)).\n\nLet us consider an algorithm to find \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt A}\\) from \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T\\). (Same applies to B, and for ? we can take their sum.)\n\nInitially, initialize \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt A}[P]=0\\) for all \\(P\\).\nFor all possible \\(P\\), do the following:\n\nIf \\(P+\\mathtt A\\) is a length-\\(W\\) palindrome, do nothing.\nOtherwise, let \\(P ^ \\prime\\) be the string formed by the last \\(\\min\\lbrace K-1,|P|+1\\rbrace\\) characters of \\(P+\\mathtt A\\). Add \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ T[P]\\) to \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ {T+\\mathtt A}[P ^ \\prime]\\).\n\nConsider finding \\(\\operatorname{dp} _ S\\) for the given string \\(S\\) using these values. \nEven if you spend \\(\\Theta(K)\\) time to check if a string is palindrome, the overall complexity is \\(O(2 ^ KKN)\\), which is fast enough.\n\nFor implementation, one can use a string or a non-negative integer as the key of the DP table. \nIf you use a string, the key is easy to understand, and you can also use a sentinel to evaluate the DP table for string of length less than \\(K\\), but the constant factor may be bad. \nIf you use a non-negative integer, the constant factors of the time and spatial complexity is good, but the implementation may be complicated.\n\nSample Code:\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef main():\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    S = input()\n\n    not_palindrome = []\n    for i in range(1 << K):\n        is_palindrome = True\n        j, k = 0, K - 1\n        while j < k:\n            if ((1 & (i >> j)) != (1 & (i >> k))):\n                is_palindrome = False\n                break\n            j += 1\n            k -= 1\n        if not is_palindrome:\n            not_palindrome.append(i)\n\n    dp = [0] * (1 << (K - 1))\n    prev = [0] * (1 << (K - 1))\n    a_mask = 0\n    q_mask = 0\n    for c in S[:K - 1]:\n        a_mask = (a_mask * 2) + (c == 'A')\n        q_mask = (q_mask * 2) + (c != '?')\n\n    for i in range(q_mask, 1 << (K - 1)):\n        if i | q_mask == i:\n            dp[i ^ a_mask] = 1\n\n    mask = (1 << (K - 1)) - 1\n    for c in S[K - 1:]:\n        dp, prev = prev, [0] * (1 << (K - 1))\n        \n        if c != 'B':\n            for i in not_palindrome:\n                if ~i & 1:\n                    dp[i & mask] += prev[i // 2]\n\n        if c != 'A':\n            for i in not_palindrome:\n                if i & 1:\n                    dp[i & mask] += prev[i // 2]\n\n    print(sum(dp) % 998244353)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n```python\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\n\nS = input()\n\nmp = {'C' * (K - 1) : 1}\n\nfor c in S:\n    tmp = ({s + 'A' : v for s, v in mp.items()} if c != 'B' else {}) | ({s + 'B' : v for s, v in mp.items()} if c != 'A' else {})\n    \n    mp = {}\n    \n    for s, v in tmp.items():\n        if s != s[::-1]:\n            if s[1:] in mp:\n                mp[s[1:]] += v\n            else:\n                mp[s[1:]] = v\n\nprint(sum(mp.values()) % 998244353)\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc359_d"]}, "abc324_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nProblem Statement:\nYou are given a horizontally written text.

Replacing this in the equation, we get:\n\n\\(T+S'+T+T+T+S'+T+T+S' = T+T+T+T+S'+T+T+T\\)\n\nNext, \\(S'\\) must be a prefix of \\(T\\), and \\(T\\) can be expressed as \\(T=S'+T'\\) using \\(T'\\) with \\(|T'|=2\\).

We referred to an editorial slide by Yoichi Iwata. A city, road, and cost are simply a vertex, edge, and weight. In an optimal solution, the graph defined by the set of edges to be extended as well as their adjacent vertices forms a tree. For a subset of the vertex set \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}\\) and vertex \\(v\\), \\(f(S,v)\\) is the minimum total weight of the edges of a tree containing vertex \\(v\\) and all vertices in \\(S\\). We seek \\(f(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}, v)\\) for each \\(K\\leq v\\leq N\\).\n\nThe function \\(f(S,v)\\) can be calculated with Dynamic Programming (DP), using initial values \\(f(\\{i\\}, i)=0\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq K-1)\\).

We will try to exploit the special form of the graph to optimize Kruskal\u2019s algorithm against it. We first sort the edges by their costs and appropriately reassign indices so that \\(C_1 \\leq C_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq C_Q\\). According to Kruskal\u2019s algorithm, one can determine the minimum spanning tree as follows:\n\nPrepare an \\((N + Q)\\)-vertex graph without an edge. For \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots ,Q\\) in order:\n\nFor each \\(j = L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i\\) in order, add an edge between vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) of cost \\(C_i\\) if and only if vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are not connected.\n\nWhile it is still difficult to handle the conditions, one can notice that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are always disconnected if \\(j =L_i\\), and that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\((j - 1)\\) are connected if and only if vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are, in order to realize that it is sufficient to perform connectivity check for vertices with adjacent indices: \\(j - 1\\) and \\(j\\). Also, the graph is disconnected if and only if there exists an integer \\(j\\) between \\(1\\) and \\((N-1)\\) (inclusive) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected. Naively implementing this still costs \\(\\Theta(NQ + Q\\log Q)\\), but now that the problem is simplified, there are various approaches.\n\n(1) Use a set (or similar data structure) Manage the set of \\(1 \\leq j < N\\) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected in a data structure like the built-in set in Python, and remove those among \\(L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i - 1\\) that is not in the set. Naively checking the existence for each element still leads to TLE, but one can use a method such as bisect.bisect_left that retrieves the position of the minimum element greater than or equal to \\(x\\), as removal of an element occurs at most \\((N - 1)\\) times and the complexity is bounded by \\(O((N + Q) \\log N)\\), which is fast enough.\n\n(2) Use a lazy segment tree One can also use a lazy segment tree that supports segment-sum retrieval and segment-filling with \\(0\\). The \\(j\\)-th element of the lazy segment tree should be \\(0\\) if vertices \\(j\\) and \\((j+1)\\) are connected, and \\(1\\) otherwise. Initialize such a segment tree of length \\((N-1)\\) all with \\(1\\); then the number of edges connecting vertex \\(N + i\\) and any of vertices \\(L_i + 1, L_i + 2, \\ldots, R_i\\) can be retrieved as the segment sum of \\([L_i, R_i)\\), and adding an edge is fulfilled by filling \\([L_i, R_i)\\) with \\(0\\).\n\n(3) Use bitwise operations While a naive scan-based algorithm on an array results in TLE (Time Limit Exceeded), one can make use of bitwise operations with almost the same idea. The answer can be found fast enough by managing connectivity for each \\((j, j+1)\\) using the built-in int type in Python and using a function that returns the next position of \\(1\\) in the same way as found in (1), the answer can be found fast enough.\n        [END TEXT]\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc364_f"]}, "abc326_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nTiles are laid out on a coordinate plane.

If \\(K=1\\), it immediately follows that this is equal to the answer. Now, we assume \\(K\\geq2\\). If the answer is strictly less than this upper bound, then optimal paths pass through a large tile.\n\nWe enumerate all possible large tiles passing through for the first and last time in an optimal tour. The possible candidates of the first large tiles are:\n\n- If \\((S _ x+0.5,S _ y+0.5)\\) is on a large tile, then that large tile.\n- Otherwise, for each of the four directions, the first large tile you pass through when moving in that direction, totaling four large tiles.\n\nOne can immediately calculate tolls from the tile containing \\((S _ x+0.5,S _ y+0.5)\\) to each large tile. The last large tile is also limited to four candidates, and the toll required to reach from each large tile to \\((T _ x+0.5,T _ y+0.5)\\) as well. For these at most \\(16\\) pairs, it is sufficient to find the minimum toll required to travel between large tiles. One can use pruning to reduce pairs, but it is fast enough without it.\n\nWe consider how to find the minimum toll required to travel between two tiles.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc326_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given two permutations \\( P = (P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_N) \\) and \\( Q = (Q_1, Q_2, \\dots, Q_N) \\) of \\( (1, 2, \\dots, N) \\).\n\nWrite one of the characters '0' and '1' in each cell of an \\( N \\)-by-\\( N \\) grid so that all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.

The expected value is \\(1 \\cdot Q_1 + 2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\dots + (N+1) \\cdot Q_{N+1}\\). Using \\(Q_i = P_i - P_{i+1}\\), this can be rewritten as \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\n\\(P_{i+1}\\) is equivalent to the probability that there is no duplicating color after drawing \\(i\\) socks. Denote \\(f_i\\) as the number of ways to choose \\(i\\) socks with different colors among the \\(S\\) socks: \\(P_{i+1} = \\frac{f_i}{\\binom{S}{i}}\\). Finding \\(\\binom{S}{0}, \\binom{S}{1}, \\dots, \\binom{S}{N}\\) is trivial, so the task is to find \\(f_i\\).\n\nDefine a polynomial \\(F = \\sum_{i=0}^{S} f_i x^i\\).

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

When there are two or more integers left on the blackboard, we should add the maximum and minimum values. The absolute value of their sum does not exceed \\(R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the multiset of integers on the blackboard, with maximum \\(M\\) and minimum \\(m\\). The absolute value of every element in \\(X\\) is at most \\(R\\), and \\(\\displaystyle\\left|\\sum_{x\\in X}x\\right|\\leq R\\).\n\n1. If \\(m \\geq 0\\), all integers are non-negative: \\(0 \\leq m + M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n2. If \\(M \\leq 0\\), all integers are non-positive: \\(0 \\geq m + M \\geq -R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n3. If \\(m \\leq 0\\) and \\(M \\geq 0\\), \\(-R \\leq m \\leq m + M \\leq M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n\nWe should add the maximum and minimum values. Use merge sort to arrange values in ascending order. Perform addition interactions to add the minimum and maximum values. Remove the first and last elements and insert the sum.

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc330_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 500 points\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThis is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).\n\n- You are given a positive integer \\( N \\).\n- The judge has a hidden positive integer \\( R \\) and \\( N \\) integers \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N \\).

Specifically, \\( X_i = A_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N \\).\n\nIn one interaction, you can specify two distinct positive integers \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) and choose one of the following actions:\n\n1. Perform addition. The judge will erase \\( X_i \\) and \\( X_j \\) from the blackboard and write \\( X_i + X_j \\) on the blackboard.\n   - \\(|X_i + X_j| \\leq R\\) must hold.\n\n2. Perform comparison. The judge will tell you whether \\( X_i < X_j \\) is true or false.\n\nNote: At the beginning of each interaction, the \\( i \\)-th and \\( j \\)-th integers written on the blackboard must not have been erased.\n\nPerform the interactions appropriately so that after all interactions, the blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\).\n\nThe values of \\( R \\) and \\( A_i \\) are determined before the start of the conversation between your program and the judge.\n\nConstraints:\n- \\( 2 \\leq N \\leq 1000 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9 \\)\n- \\(|A_i| \\leq R\\)\n- \\(\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\right| \\le R\\)\n- \\( N, R, \\) and \\( A_i \\) are integers.\n\nInput and Output\n\nThis is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).\n\n- First, read \\( N \\) from Standard Input.\n\n  ```\n  N\n  ```\n\n- Next, repeat the interactions until the blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\).\n\n- When performing addition, make an output in the following format to Standard Output.

Here, \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) are distinct positive integers.\n\n  ```\n  ? i j\n  ```\n\n- The response from the judge will be given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n  ```\n  Q\n  ```\n\n  Here, \\( Q \\) is an integer:\n\n  - If \\( Q = 1 \\), it means that \\( X_i < X_j \\) is true.\n  - If \\( Q = 0 \\), it means that \\( X_i < X_j \\) is false.\n  - If \\( Q = -1 \\), it means that \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) do not satisfy the constraints, or the number of interactions has exceeded 25000.\n\nFor both types of interactions, if the judge's response is -1, your program is already considered incorrect. In this case, terminate your program immediately.\n\nWhen the blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\), report this to the judge in the following format. This does not count towards the number of interactions. Then, terminate your program immediately.\n\n  ```\n  !\n  ```\n\nIf you make an output in a format that does not match any of the above, -1 will be given from Standard Input.\n\n  ```\n  -1\n  ```\n\nIn this case, your program is already considered incorrect. Terminate your program immediately.\n\nNotes\n\n- For each output, append a newline at the end and flush Standard Output. Otherwise, the verdict may be TLE.\n- Terminate your program immediately after outputting the result (or receiving -1). Otherwise, the verdict will be indeterminate.\n- Extra newlines will be considered as malformed output.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\nHere is a possible conversation with \\( N=3, R=10, A_1=-1, A_2=10, A_3=1 \\).\n\n**Input:**\n```\n3\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n? 1 2\n1\n+ 1 3\n4\n+ 2 4\n5\n!\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. First, the integer \\( N \\) is given.\n2. Perform a comparison between \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\). The judge returns 1 because \\( X_1 < X_2 \\) (-1 < 10).\n3. Perform an addition of \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_3 \\). The judge erases \\( X_1 = -1 \\) and \\( X_3 = 1 \\) from the blackboard and writes \\( X_1 + X_3 = 0 \\). This is the fourth integer written.\n4. Perform an addition of \\( X_2 \\) and \\( X_4 \\). The judge erases \\( X_2 = 10 \\) and \\( X_4 = 0 \\) from the blackboard and writes \\( X_2 + X_4 = 10 \\). This is the fifth integer written.\n5. The blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\), so report this to the judge.\n\nSolution:\n\nBelow is the editorial as provided, since there's no code to translate to Python3:\n\n```\nAtCoder Regular Contest 179 - C: Beware of Overflow Editorial\n\nTo have only one integer on the blackboard, we need to perform exactly \\(N-1\\) additions. When there are two or more integers left on the blackboard, we should add the maximum and minimum values. The absolute value of their sum does not exceed \\(R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the multiset of integers on the blackboard, with maximum \\(M\\) and minimum \\(m\\). The absolute value of every element in \\(X\\) is at most \\(R\\), and \\(\\displaystyle\\left|\\sum_{x\\in X}x\\right|\\leq R\\).\n\n1. If \\(m \\geq 0\\), all integers are non-negative: \\(0 \\leq m + M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n2. If \\(M \\leq 0\\), all integers are non-positive: \\(0 \\geq m + M \\geq -R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n3. If \\(m \\leq 0\\) and \\(M \\geq 0\\), \\(-R \\leq m \\leq m + M \\leq M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n\nWe should add the maximum and minimum values. Use merge sort to arrange values in ascending order. Perform addition interactions to add the minimum and maximum values. Remove the first and last elements and insert the sum. Binary search determines the insertion position.\n\nEstimate interactions: Merge sort on a list of length \\(2^n\\) requires at most \\(a_n = n2^n\\) comparisons. Under \\(N \\leq 1000 \\leq 2^{10}\\), at most 10240 comparisons are needed. Finding insertion positions requires at most \\(10 \\times (N-1) \\leq 9990\\) comparisons. In total, at most 20230 comparisons plus \\(N-1 \\leq 999\\) additions remain well within the limit of 25000 interactions.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc179_c"]}, "abc330_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThe pattern of AtCoder's wallpaper can be represented on the xy-plane as follows:\n\n- The plane is divided by the following three types of lines:\n  - \\( x = n \\) (where \\( n \\) is an integer)\n  - \\( y = n \\) (where \\( n \\) is an even number)\n  - \\( x + y = n \\) (where \\( n \\) is an even number)\n\n- Each region is painted black or white.

Thus, one can solve this problem by counting for each of the eight \\(1 \\times 1\\) squares how many instances of them are contained in the given rectangle. In order to count the number of squares at each position, it may be difficult to handle boundaries. As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\). Do the same thing for the \\(y\\) axis.\n\nAlso, when debugging this type of problem, it is effective to generate cases by yourself. In this problem, if it is a boundary issue that matters, it is a good idea to try many cases for \\(0 \\leq A, B, C, D \\leq 8\\).\n\nSample code (Python):\n```python\nmass = [[2, 1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 2, 1, 0]]\n# mass[i][j] : area of rectangle [[j, j + 1], [i, i + 1]] x 2\n\ninf = 4000000000\n\n# input\na, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n\n# calculation\nans = 0\nfor fy in range(2):\n    for fx in range(4):\n        x1 = (a - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        x2 = (c - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        count_x = x2 - x1  # count along x axis\n        y1 = (b - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        y2 = (d - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        count_y = y2 - y1  # count along y axis\n        ans += count_x * count_y * mass[fy][fx]\n\n# output\nprint(ans)\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc354_d"]}, "abc330_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given two permutations \\( P = (P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_N) \\) and \\( Q = (Q_1, Q_2, \\dots, Q_N) \\) of \\( (1, 2, \\dots, N) \\).\n\nWrite one of the characters '0' and '1' in each cell of an \\( N \\)-by-\\( N \\) grid so that all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.

In this optimal solution, there is an \\(i\\) that violates the strategy \\((\\bigstar)\\). Take the minimum such \\(i\\). Let box \\(X\\) be the box that you would give to person \\(i\\) if you obey the strategy \\((\\bigstar)\\) up to \\(1,2,\\ldots, i-1, i\\). In the taken optimal solution, if box \\(X\\) is not given to anyone, then giving person \\(i\\) box \\(X\\) improves the solution, which contradicts the optimality. Thus you will give it to a person \\(j\\). Consider swapping the boxes to give to person \\(i\\) and to person \\(j\\). This operation keeps optimality, but the minimum \\(i\\) that violates \\((\\bigstar)\\) strictly increases, so repeating this yields a contradiction. Hence, the greedy algorithm has been justified.\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient to simulate this greedy algorithm fast enough. This can be done by using a data structure like `sortedcontainers.SortedList` in Python, or using the sliding window trick by using the fact that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be sorted without changing the answer.\n[END TEXT]\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc358_d"]}, "abc332_b": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThere is a long water tank with boards of different heights placed at equal intervals.

Consider a graph where we draw an edge from \\(i\\) to \\(A_i\\). Focus on vertex \\(N\\). First, consider whether vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle. \n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is included in a cycle: The balls in this cycle correspond to those that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\).\n\nIf vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle: Some cycle corresponds to the balls that were in box \\(N\\) before the operation. We break this cycle and add edges from the vertices on the cycle to vertex \\(N\\). Here, it\u2019s also permissible to assume that box \\(N\\) was empty and change nothing.\n\nIn either case, if there exists a \u201cchild\u201d of vertex \\(N\\) (a vertex that extends an edge to vertex \\(N\\) and is not included in a cycle), it\u2019s impossible to reverse the operation, and we can conclude that the answer is No. When vertex \\(N\\) is not included in a cycle, there is freedom in choosing which cycle to break, but here, let\u2019s suppose we use the cycle in the connected component that includes vertex \\(N\\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider the conditions under which we can complete the reversal for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, 1\\) when the operation can only be reversed in this form. Then, as a sufficient condition, we obtain that the following property holds for each vertex \\(v\\):\n\nLet \\(u_1, \\cdots, u_k\\) be the children of \\(v\\). Let \\(w_i\\) be the largest numbered vertex in the subtree rooted at \\(u_i\\). Then, \\(v < w_i\\).\n\nIn fact, this condition is also a necessary condition in the original problem (without limiting the form of the reversal operation). Therefore, by simply checking this condition, we can solve the problem. We will show that this condition is necessary. Take a vertex \\(v\\) that does not satisfy the condition and its child \\(u\\). No matter how we reverse the operations for \\(i = N, N-1, \\cdots, v + 1\\), they will not affect the subtree rooted at vertex \\(u\\). Then, consider \\(i = v\\), and \\(v\\) will have a child \\(u\\), so the reversal fails. This shows the necessity. The condition can be checked in \\(O(N)\\) time.

Consequently, if there is an edge between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\), then there are also edges between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Thus, one can only add edges between adjacent elements in the sorted \\(S\\) without changing connectivity.\n\nFirst, consider a graph with \\(N\\) vertices and \\(0\\) edges. Two types of queries are:\n\n1. Given \\(x\\), add an edge between vertices \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\) if absent, or remove it if present.\n2. Find the size of the connected component containing vertex \\(x\\).\n\nLet \\(A_i\\) be \\(1\\) if there is an edge between \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\), and \\(0\\) otherwise. The two queries can be processed as follows:\n\n- Addition and deletion of an edge are done by updating \\(A_i\\).\n- To find how far the connected component containing \\(x\\) extends to the right, \\(y > x\\) is connected to \\(x\\) if and only if \\(A[x] + \\ldots + A[y-1] = y-x\\). The maximum such \\(y\\) can be quickly found with binary search by finding the segment sum of \\(A\\). The same applies to the left.\n\nThe altered question can be solved by managing the array \\(A\\) in a segment tree. The original problem asks to add or remove vertices by maintaining the following two arrays \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as segment trees to manage the existence of vertices and edges:\n\n- \\(A_i = 1\\) if \\(x\\) is contained in \\(S\\), and \\(A_i = 0\\) otherwise.\n- \\(B_i = 1\\) if there is an edge between \\(x\\) and \u201cthe next vertex to the right,\u201d and \\(B_i = 0\\) otherwise.\n\nCoordinate compression or a dynamic segment tree can keep the number of nodes small, making the complexity \\(O(Q\\log Q)\\) or \\(O(Q\\log\\max x_i)\\).\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc356_f"]}, "abc333_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given positive integers \\(N\\) and \\(K\\).\n\nAn integer sequence of length \\(N\\) where all elements are between \\(1\\) and \\(2^K - 1\\), inclusive, is called a **good sequence**.\n\nThe **score** of a good sequence \\(A = (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N)\\) is defined as follows:\n- The number of distinct integers that can be expressed as \\(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) using an integer \\(i\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(N\\), inclusive, and a non-negative integer \\(k\\).\n\nFor example, for \\(A = (3, 5)\\), five integers can be expressed as \\(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\): \\(0, 1, 2, 3,\\) and \\(5\\), so the score is \\(5\\).\n\nFind one good sequence with the maximum score.\n\nFor each input file, you are given \\(T\\) test cases to solve.\n\n### Constraints\n- \\(1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq K \\leq 30\\)\n- The sum of \\(N\\) across the test cases in a single input file is at most \\(2 \\times 10^5\\).\n- All input values are integers.\n\n### Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format.

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem. The time complexity is \\(O(NK)\\) due to the bit-reversal calculation being the bottleneck.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n\n    def bit_reversal(x):\n        return int(bin(x)[2:].zfill(K - 1)[::-1], 2)\n\n    if N >= 2 ** (K - 1):\n        print(*[max(1, 2**K - i - 1) for i in range(N)])\n    else:\n        print(*[2 ** (K - 1) + bit_reversal(i) for i in range(N)])\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also solve it by constructing from the highest bit downwards.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    C = [1]\n    for _ in range(1, K):\n        D = [2 * c for c in C] + [2 * c + 1 for c in C]\n        C = D[:N]\n    while len(C) < N:\n        C.append(1)\n    print(*C)\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc182_b"]}, "abc333_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given a tree with \\( N \\) vertices numbered \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, N \\).

We will perform operation 1 as needed and consider the following operations:\n\nOperation A: When the piece and the gate are on the same vertex, move both the piece and the gate to an adjacent vertex. Operation B: Move the piece to an adjacent vertex. Operation C: Move the piece to the vertex where the gate is located.\n\nOperations A and B each incur a cost of 1. Once operation B is performed, the gate remains in its position until operation C is performed. It's inefficient to move the piece to the gate using operation B, so we will not consider this.\n\nLet \\(v\\) be the initial position of the piece and gate. By performing operation C at the end, the process ends when the piece and the gate are on the same vertex. Label the vertices and edges the gate moves to with A, and the rest with B. The vertices and edges labeled A form a connected subgraph, or subtree A. Vertex \\(v\\) is included in subtree A. Edges labeled B with one endpoint as A are boundary edges.\n\nVertices and edges labeled B not connected to boundary edges form connected components. Each component is a tree connected to a vertex in subtree A by a boundary edge \\(e_i\\). Let them form subtree \\(B_i\\), connected to vertex \\(l_i\\) in A.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. In optimal operations, assume edges labeled A are not traversed by operation B. By rearranging operations, the cost does not increase:\n\n   - The piece and gate start from \\(v\\), visit all vertices in A using operation A, and return to \\(v\\). This is the journey in A.\n   - If \\(l_i\\) is visited during A's journey, it's interrupted. The piece starts from \\(l_i\\), visits all vertices in \\(B_i\\) using operation B, and returns to \\(l_i\\). This is the journey in \\(B_i\\). The gate stays at \\(l_i\\).\n\n2. Assume moving along boundary edge \\(e_i\\) occurs only once in B's journey. If done more than once, moving with the gate using operation A during the first move and returning does not increase the cost. In \\(B_i\\)'s journey, operation C is done once at the end.\n\n3. In the journeys of A and \\(B_i\\), the farthest vertex is visited last. If the distance from start to the farthest vertex is \\(d\\) and the number of edges is \\(m\\), the cost is \\(2m - d\\).\n\nThe total number of edges in subtrees is \\(N-1\\). Minimize cost by maximizing \\(d\\)'s total sum. Calculate for fixed \\(v\\) using tree DP. Maintain:\n\n- Maximum distance to vertex where \\(B_i\\)'s journey ends, assuming \\(u = l_i\\).\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n- Maximum \\(d\\)'s sum if \\(u\\) is in A and A's journey ends in a vertex not in \\(u\\)'s subtree.\n\nExtend to rerooting DP to examine all possible starting vertices.

The blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\), so report this to the judge.\n\nSolution:\n\nBelow is the editorial as provided, since there's no code to translate to Python3:\n\n```\nAtCoder Regular Contest 179 - C: Beware of Overflow Editorial\n\nTo have only one integer on the blackboard, we need to perform exactly \\(N-1\\) additions. When there are two or more integers left on the blackboard, we should add the maximum and minimum values. The absolute value of their sum does not exceed \\(R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the multiset of integers on the blackboard, with maximum \\(M\\) and minimum \\(m\\). The absolute value of every element in \\(X\\) is at most \\(R\\), and \\(\\displaystyle\\left|\\sum_{x\\in X}x\\right|\\leq R\\).\n\n1. If \\(m \\geq 0\\), all integers are non-negative: \\(0 \\leq m + M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n2. If \\(M \\leq 0\\), all integers are non-positive: \\(0 \\geq m + M \\geq -R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n3. If \\(m \\leq 0\\) and \\(M \\geq 0\\), \\(-R \\leq m \\leq m + M \\leq M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n\nWe should add the maximum and minimum values. Use merge sort to arrange values in ascending order. Perform addition interactions to add the minimum and maximum values. Remove the first and last elements and insert the sum. Binary search determines the insertion position.\n\nEstimate interactions: Merge sort on a list of length \\(2^n\\) requires at most \\(a_n = n2^n\\) comparisons. Under \\(N \\leq 1000 \\leq 2^{10}\\), at most 10240 comparisons are needed. Finding insertion positions requires at most \\(10 \\times (N-1) \\leq 9990\\) comparisons. In total, at most 20230 comparisons plus \\(N-1 \\leq 999\\) additions remain well within the limit of 25000 interactions.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc179_c"]}, "abc334_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nTakahashi has various colors of socks in his chest of drawers.

Once a sock is drawn, it will not be returned to the chest.\n\nFind the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the number of times he has to draw a sock from the chest.\n\nIt can be proved that the sought expected value is always rational. Furthermore, the constraints of this problem guarantee that if the expected value is expressed as an irreducible fraction \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), then \\( x \\) is not divisible by 998244353.

The socks drawn so far are two of color 1 and one of color 2, allowing a pair of color 1 socks to be made, thus ending the operation.\n\nIn this example, Takahashi draws a sock from the chest three times. The expected number of times Takahashi draws a sock from the chest is 3 with probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) and 2 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), so the expected value is \\( 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} \\equiv 665496238 \\pmod{998244353} \\).\n\n**Sample Input 2:**\n```\n1\n352\n```\n\n**Sample Output 2:**\n```\n2\n```\n\n**Sample Input 3:**\n```\n6\n1796 905 2768 253 2713 1448\n```\n\n**Sample Output 3:**\n```\n887165507\n```\n\nSolution:\n\n        Here is the cleaned version of the editorial content without extraneous information:\n\n---\n\nLet \\(S = A_1 + A_2 + \\dots + A_N\\).

The expected value is \\(1 \\cdot Q_1 + 2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\dots + (N+1) \\cdot Q_{N+1}\\). Using \\(Q_i = P_i - P_{i+1}\\), this can be rewritten as \\(P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{N+1}\\).\n\n\\(P_{i+1}\\) is equivalent to the probability that there is no duplicating color after drawing \\(i\\) socks. Denote \\(f_i\\) as the number of ways to choose \\(i\\) socks with different colors among the \\(S\\) socks: \\(P_{i+1} = \\frac{f_i}{\\binom{S}{i}}\\).

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem.

Solve for red, then add results.  \n\n**Properties:**  \n- Minimum cells to repaint red = minimum white cells passed from top-left to bottom-right.  \nLet \\(a\\) be cells repainted red, and \\(b\\) be white cells passed.  \n- \\(b \\geq a\\): A path through \\(b\\) white cells can be repainted to move.  \n- \\(b \\leq a\\): A method with \\(a\\) repaintings moves without more than \\(a\\) white cells.  \nThus, \\(a = b\\).\n\n**Find Minimum White Cells Passed:**  \nReduce to shortest path problem:  \n- Each cell is a vertex; cost is 1 for white and 0 otherwise.  \n- Use Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm (\\(O(N^2 \\log N)\\) time).

We assume the knowledge of cumulative sums for a sequence (one-dimensional cumulative sums).\n\nGiven a length-\\(N\\) sequence \\(A\\), process \\(Q\\) queries. In the \\(i\\)-th query, given an integer pair \\((L_i,R_i)\\) satisfying \\(1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N\\), find \\(\\sum_{k=L_i}^{R_i}A_k\\).\n\nA solution to this problem is as follows: Define a length-\\((N+1)\\) sequence \\(S=(S_0,S_1,\\ldots S_N)\\) by \\(S_0=0,S_i=\\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}A_k\\), and use \\(\\sum_{k=L_i}^{R_i}A_k=S_{R_i+1}-S_{L_i}\\) to answer the query fast. The sequence \\(S\\) is called the cumulative sums of \\(A\\).\n\nThe original problem is an extension of this one-dimensional cumulative sum problem into three dimensions.\n\nConsider \\(S\\) such that \\(S_{i,j,k}=\\sum_{x=1}^{i-1} \\sum_{y=1}^{j-1}\\sum_{z=1}^{k-1}A_{x,y,z}\\) for \\(1 \\leq i,j,k \\leq N+1\\). If \\(i\\), \\(j\\), or \\(k\\) is \\(0\\), define \\(S_{i,j,k}=0\\).\n\nIt holds that \\(\\sum_{x=Lx_i}^{Rx_i} \\sum_{y=Ly_i}^{Ry_i} \\sum_{z=Lz_i}^{Rz_i} A_{x,y,z}=S_{Rx_i+1,Ry_i+1,Rz_i+1}-S_{Lx_i,Rx_i+1,Rz_i+1}-S_{Rx_i+1,Ly_i,Rz_i+1}-S_{Rx_i+1,Ry_i+1,Lz_i}+S_{Lx_i,Ly_i,Rz_i+1}+S_{Lx_i,Ry_i+1,Lz_i}+S_{Rx_i+1,Ly_i,Lz_i}-S_{Lx_i,Ly_i,Lz_i}\\).\n\nTherefore, if one can compute \\(S\\) fast, then each query can be answered in constant time.\n\n\\(S\\) can be found by the property that \\(S_{i,j,k}=S_{i-1,j,k}+S_{i,j-1,k}+S_{i,j,k-1}-S_{i-1,j-1,k}-S_{i-1,j,k-1}-S_{i,j-1,k-1}+S_{i-1,j-1,k-1}+A_{i-1,j-1,k-1}\\).

The key is to determine cycles in the permutation \\(P\\), and within each cycle, find the lexicographically smallest permutation. For a cycle with length \\(L\\), the number of minimal positions is \\(L / \\gcd(L, \\text{period})\\). We choose the minimal lexicographical arrangement by evaluating potential positions and adjusting the operation count \\(ans\\) accordingly. The process involves updating a result array based on minimized operations for each cycle, taking care of integer operations due to potential size. Here is the sample code:\n\n```python\nfrom math import gcd\n\nN = int(input())\nP = [int(x) - 1 for x in input().split()]\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nused = [False for i in range(N)]\n\nperiod = 1\nans = 0\n\nresult = [0 for i in range(N)]\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    if not used[i]:\n        cycle = [i]\n        while P[cycle[-1]] != i:\n            used[P[cycle[-1]]] = True\n            cycle.append(P[cycle[-1]])\n            \n        L = len(cycle)\n        choose = L // gcd(L, period)\n        offset = min((A[cycle[(ans + i * period) % L]], i) for i in range(choose))[1]\n        \n        ans += offset * period\n        period *= choose\n        \n        for i in range(L):\n            result[cycle[i]] = A[cycle[(i + ans) % L]]\n\nprint(*result)\n```\nThis effectively computes the lexicographically smallest permutation using the described method.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc371_g"]}, "abc336_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nTakahashi has a piano with 100 keys arranged in a row.

First, it is unnecessary to include elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) in \\(A\\). This is because replacing elements less than \\(2^{K-1}\\) with their double will result in the same or a higher score. Therefore, we can limit the elements of \\(A\\) to be between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\).\n\n1. When \\(N \\geq 2^{K-1}\\): We can include all elements between \\(2^{K-1}\\) and \\(2^K-1\\) in \\(A\\) and set \\(A_i = \\max(1, 2^K - 1 - i)\\) \\((0 \\le i < N)\\).\n\n2. When \\(N < 2^{K-1}\\): Consider an upper bound of the score. For \\(0 \\le x < K\\), consider the number of elements that appear as \\(\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor\\) between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}-1\\). For each \\(A_i\\), there is at most one \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(\\displaystyle 2^x \\le \\left\\lfloor\\frac{A_i}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor < 2^{x+1}\\), so the number of such elements is at most \\(N\\). On the other hand, there are only \\(2^x\\) integers between \\(2^x\\) and \\(2^{x+1}\\), so the number of elements that appear in this range is at most \\(\\min(N, 2^x)\\). Therefore, by summing over all \\(x\\), the score has an upper bound of \\(\\displaystyle 1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}\\min(N, 2^x)\\).\n\nThis upper bound can always be achieved. Specifically, construct \\(A\\) as follows: Set \\(A_i\\) to the sum of \\(2^{K-1}\\) and the bit-reversal of \\(i\\). \u201cThe bit-reversal of \\(i\\)\u201d means the value obtained by reversing the \\((K-1)\\)-bit binary representation of \\(i\\).\n\nBy implementing the above, we can solve this problem. The time complexity is \\(O(NK)\\) due to the bit-reversal calculation being the bottleneck.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n\n    def bit_reversal(x):\n        return int(bin(x)[2:].zfill(K - 1)[::-1], 2)\n\n    if N >= 2 ** (K - 1):\n        print(*[max(1, 2**K - i - 1) for i in range(N)])\n    else:\n        print(*[2 ** (K - 1) + bit_reversal(i) for i in range(N)])\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also solve it by constructing from the highest bit downwards.\n\nSample Implementation (Python3)\n```python\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    C = [1]\n    for _ in range(1, K):\n        D = [2 * c for c in C] + [2 * c + 1 for c in C]\n        C = D[:N]\n    while len(C) < N:\n        C.append(1)\n    print(*C)\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc182_b"]}, "abc336_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nYou are given an integer \\( K \\).

Specifically:\n- If the two coins are both genuine or both counterfeit, they are judged to be of the same type.\n- Otherwise, they are judged to be of different types.\n\nIdentify all the counterfeit coins using at most \\( Q \\) appraisals.\n\n**Constraints**\n- \\( N = 1000 \\)\n- \\( M = 10 \\)\n- \\( Q = 950 \\)\n\n**Interaction**\n\nThis is an interactive problem. Initially, receive \\( N \\), \\( M \\), and \\( Q \\) from Standard Input:\n\n```\nN M Q\n```\n\nNext, you can perform appraisals between 0 and \\( Q \\) times, inclusive, as follows.\n\nFirst, by outputting to Standard Output in the following format, you indicate that you are appraising coins \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). (Include a newline at the end.)\n\n```\n? x y\n```\n\nHere, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be distinct integers between 1 and \\( N \\), inclusive.\n\nIn response, the judge system will reply with one of the following three responses.\n\n- `0`: If the response is `0`, it means that coins \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are of the same type.\n- `1`: If the response is `1`, it means that coins \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are of different types.\n- `-1`: If the response is `-1`, it means that the appraisal is invalid. Specifically, this response is given when at least one of the following conditions is met:\n  - The outputted \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) do not satisfy the constraints.\n  - The number of appraisals exceeds \\( Q \\).\n\nIf you receive this response, your program is considered incorrect. Terminate your program immediately.\n\nFinally, by outputting to Standard Output in the following format, you answer that coins \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_M \\) are counterfeit. (Include a newline at the end.)\n\n```\n! A_1 A_2 \\dots A_M\n```\n\nHere, \\( A_i \\) must be distinct integers between 1 and \\( N \\), inclusive. After this output, terminate your program immediately.\n\nIf any of your outputs do not meet the specified format, your program will be considered incorrect. The judge will then respond with `-1`, so in that case, terminate your program immediately.\n\n**Notes**\n- Every time you output, include a newline at the end and flush Standard Output. Failure to do so may result in a verdict of Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) or Wrong Answer (WA).\n- After outputting your answer (or receiving `-1`), terminate your program immediately. Otherwise, the verdict is indeterminate.\n- Beware that unnecessary newlines are considered malformed.\n- The judge for this problem is adaptive. That is, at any point, as long as consistency can be maintained, the judge may change which coins are counterfeit. See the sample interaction for details.\n\n**Sample Interaction**\n\nIn this interaction, \\( N = 5 \\), \\( M = 2 \\), \\( Q = 10 \\), and the judge initially considers coins 1 and 2 to be counterfeit.\n\n*Note*: This example does not meet the constraints and is not included in the judge.\n\n**Input**\n```\n5 2 10\n```\n**Output**\n```\n? 1 2\n```\n**Explanation**: You appraise coins 1 and 2.\n\n**Input**\n```\n0\n```\n**Explanation**: Coins 1 and 2 are judged to be of the same type.\n\n**Output**\n```\n? 1 3\n```\n**Explanation**: You appraise coins 1 and 3.\n\n**Input**\n```\n1\n```\n**Explanation**: Coins 1 and 3 are judged to be of different types.\n\n**Output**\n```\n? 1 4\n```\n**Explanation**: You appraise coins 1 and 4.\n\n**Input**\n```\n1\n```\n**Explanation**: Coins 1 and 4 are judged to be of different types.\n\n**Output**\n```\n! 1 2\n```\n**Explanation**: You answer that coins 1 and 2 are counterfeit.\n\nIndeed, coins 1 and 2 are considered counterfeit, but it is also possible to consider coins 3 and 4 as counterfeit while maintaining consistency. Therefore, the judge may change the counterfeit coins to 3 and 4. As a result, the judge may judge this answer as incorrect.\n\nSolution:\n\n```python\nEditorial - AtCoder Regular Contest 184\n\nA - Appraiser Editorial by evima\n\nThe key point of this problem is that there are more genuine coins than counterfeit coins. Since there are \\(10\\) counterfeit coins, any group of \\(11\\) or more coins of the same type must be genuine.\n\nConsider dividing the \\(1000\\) coins into groups of \\(11\\). There will be \\(90\\) groups of \\(11\\) coins and a remainder of \\(10\\) coins. Among these \\(90\\) groups, at most \\(10\\) groups may contain counterfeit coins, so we can obtain at least \\(80\\) groups of \\(11\\) coins that are all of the same type. Also, we need \\(10\\) inspections to divide a group of \\(11\\) coins into two types (without knowing which is genuine).\n\nFirst, use \\(900\\) inspections to divide all the \\(11\\)-coin groups into two types. Next, exclude the coins that have been identified as genuine (where all \\(11\\) coins are of the same type). Record one coin number \\(x\\) identified as genuine. We have up to \\(20\\) groups of coins whose type is undetermined, and the \\(10\\) leftover coins. Using up to an additional \\(30\\) inspections, determine whether each remaining coin is of the same type as \\(x\\) to identify all counterfeit coins. This solution can identify all counterfeit coins using a maximum of \\(930\\) inspections.\n\nSample Implementation (Python 3):\n```python\ndef ask(x, y):\n    print(f\"? {x} {y}\")\n    # Assume here that we get a response from the interaction\n    res = int(input().strip())\n    return res\n\ndef ans(a):\n    print(\"!\", \" \".join(map(str, a)))\n\ndef main():\n    n, m, q = map(int, input().split())  # dummy input\n    ok = None\n    unknown = []\n    for i in range(90):\n        up = i * 11 + 1\n        g1 = [up]\n        g2 = []\n        for j in range(i * 11 + 2, i * 11 + 12):\n            if ask(up, j) == 0:\n                g1.append(j)\n            else:\n                g2.append(j)\n        if not g2:\n            ok = up\n        else:\n            unknown.append(g1)\n            unknown.append(g2)\n    for i in range(991, 1001):\n        unknown.append([i])\n    res = []\n    for nx in unknown:\n        if ask(nx[0], ok) == 1:\n            res.extend(nx)\n    ans(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc184_a"]}, "abc338_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 200 points\n\nProblem Statement:\nYou are given a string \\( S \\) consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

Such a pair is called an \"improvable pair.\" A permutation without any improvable pairs can be shown to be a good permutation. \n\nConsider a permutation \\(P\\) without improvable pairs. If it's possible to obtain a lexicographically smaller permutation \\(Q\\) from \\(P\\), leading to a contradiction, then \\(P\\) must be the lexicographically smallest permutation. For position \\(i\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) differ, with \\(Q_i = P_j\\), swap relevant elements \\(P_k\\) and \\(P_j\\) for \\(i \\leq k < j\\), focusing on \\(k = j - 1\\). Since \\(P_{j - 1}\\) is an ancestor of \\(P_j\\), odd arrangements are avoided, solidifying that \\(P\\) leads to \\(Q\\) and supports lexicographic minimality.\n\nTo compute \\(\\operatorname{hash}(P)\\) for all permutations \\(P\\) without any improvable pair, consider counting such \\(P\\) using tree DP. Define \\(dp[v][k]\\) as how many ways you can establish \\(k\\) paths connected by improvable pairs in the subtree rooted at vertex \\(v\\). Arrangements of \\(k\\) paths are \\(k!\\) ways, resolved during DP as subtrees merge, using combinatorics \\({a + b \\choose a}\\).\n\nFor \\(\\operatorname{hash}(P)\\), similar concepts apply. Each element is handled with weights and computed in DP tables, based on paths before and after its position. Each vertex \\(v\\) uses DP tables proportional to the square of its subtree's size. Avoiding possible high complexity, the correct computations achieve a potential \\(O(N^4)\\) efficiency, better than \\(O(N^5)\\), due to optimization techniques reminiscent of reducing some \\(O(N^3)\\) algorithms to \\(O(N^2)\\).\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_d"]}, "abc338_f": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe Country of AtCoder consists of \\( N \\) cities and \\( M \\) roads connecting them.

We referred to an editorial slide by Yoichi Iwata. A city, road, and cost are simply a vertex, edge, and weight. In an optimal solution, the graph defined by the set of edges to be extended as well as their adjacent vertices forms a tree. For a subset of the vertex set \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}\\) and vertex \\(v\\), \\(f(S,v)\\) is the minimum total weight of the edges of a tree containing vertex \\(v\\) and all vertices in \\(S\\). We seek \\(f(\\{1,2,\\dots,K-1\\}, v)\\) for each \\(K\\leq v\\leq N\\).\n\nThe function \\(f(S,v)\\) can be calculated with Dynamic Programming (DP), using initial values \\(f(\\{i\\}, i)=0\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq K-1)\\). There are two transitions: \n\n1. \\(f(S,v) \\leftarrow \\min(f(S,v),f(S,u) + w)\\) if an edge of weight \\(w\\) connects vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n2. \\(f(S,v) \\leftarrow \\min(f(S,v),f(T,v)+f(S\\setminus T,v))\\ (T\\subsetneq S, T\\neq \\emptyset)\\).\n\nThe transitions ensure efficient processing by filling the DP table in ascending order of the size of \\(S\\). The circular dependency in the former transition is managed by determining \\(f(S,v)\\) in ascending order of its value using Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. The overall complexity is \\(O(3^KN+2^KM\\log M)\\).\n\nSample code (Python3):\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef chmin(a, b):\n    return b < a\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2]) - 1\n    \n    G = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a = int(data[index]) - 1\n        b = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        G[a].append((b, c))\n        G[b].append((a, c))\n\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        dp[1 << i][i] = 0\n\n    for bit in range(1, 1 << k):\n        sub = bit\n        while sub > 0:\n            for i in range(n):\n                dp[bit][i] = min(dp[bit][i], dp[sub][i] + dp[bit - sub][i])\n            sub = (sub - 1) & bit\n\n        pq = [(dp[bit][i], i) for i in range(n)]\n        heapq.heapify(pq)\n\n        while pq:\n            d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            if d > dp[bit][u]:\n                continue\n            for v, l in G[u]:\n                if chmin(dp[bit][v], d + l):\n                    dp[bit][v] = d + l\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (d + l, v))\n\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        print(dp[-1][i])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc364_g"]}, "abc339_a": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given a string \\( S \\) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Consequently, if there is an edge between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\), then there are also edges between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Thus, one can only add edges between adjacent elements in the sorted \\(S\\) without changing connectivity.\n\nFirst, consider a graph with \\(N\\) vertices and \\(0\\) edges. Two types of queries are:\n\n1. Given \\(x\\), add an edge between vertices \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\) if absent, or remove it if present.\n2. Find the size of the connected component containing vertex \\(x\\).\n\nLet \\(A_i\\) be \\(1\\) if there is an edge between \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\), and \\(0\\) otherwise. The two queries can be processed as follows:\n\n- Addition and deletion of an edge are done by updating \\(A_i\\).\n- To find how far the connected component containing \\(x\\) extends to the right, \\(y > x\\) is connected to \\(x\\) if and only if \\(A[x] + \\ldots + A[y-1] = y-x\\). The maximum such \\(y\\) can be quickly found with binary search by finding the segment sum of \\(A\\). The same applies to the left.\n\nThe altered question can be solved by managing the array \\(A\\) in a segment tree. The original problem asks to add or remove vertices by maintaining the following two arrays \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as segment trees to manage the existence of vertices and edges:\n\n- \\(A_i = 1\\) if \\(x\\) is contained in \\(S\\), and \\(A_i = 0\\) otherwise.\n- \\(B_i = 1\\) if there is an edge between \\(x\\) and \u201cthe next vertex to the right,\u201d and \\(B_i = 0\\) otherwise.\n\nCoordinate compression or a dynamic segment tree can keep the number of nodes small, making the complexity \\(O(Q\\log Q)\\) or \\(O(Q\\log\\max x_i)\\).\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc356_f"]}, "abc340_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 500 points\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThis is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).\n\n- You are given a positive integer \\( N \\).\n- The judge has a hidden positive integer \\( R \\) and \\( N \\) integers \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N \\).

The blackboard contains only one value \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\), so report this to the judge.\n\nSolution:\n\nBelow is the editorial as provided, since there's no code to translate to Python3:\n\n```\nAtCoder Regular Contest 179 - C: Beware of Overflow Editorial\n\nTo have only one integer on the blackboard, we need to perform exactly \\(N-1\\) additions. When there are two or more integers left on the blackboard, we should add the maximum and minimum values. The absolute value of their sum does not exceed \\(R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the multiset of integers on the blackboard, with maximum \\(M\\) and minimum \\(m\\). The absolute value of every element in \\(X\\) is at most \\(R\\), and \\(\\displaystyle\\left|\\sum_{x\\in X}x\\right|\\leq R\\).\n\n1. If \\(m \\geq 0\\), all integers are non-negative: \\(0 \\leq m + M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n2. If \\(M \\leq 0\\), all integers are non-positive: \\(0 \\geq m + M \\geq -R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n3. If \\(m \\leq 0\\) and \\(M \\geq 0\\), \\(-R \\leq m \\leq m + M \\leq M \\leq R\\), so \\(|m + M| \\leq R\\).\n\nWe should add the maximum and minimum values. Use merge sort to arrange values in ascending order. Perform addition interactions to add the minimum and maximum values. Remove the first and last elements and insert the sum. Binary search determines the insertion position.\n\nEstimate interactions: Merge sort on a list of length \\(2^n\\) requires at most \\(a_n = n2^n\\) comparisons. Under \\(N \\leq 1000 \\leq 2^{10}\\), at most 10240 comparisons are needed. Finding insertion positions requires at most \\(10 \\times (N-1) \\leq 9990\\) comparisons. In total, at most 20230 comparisons plus \\(N-1 \\leq 999\\) additions remain well within the limit of 25000 interactions.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc179_c"]}, "abc340_d": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThere are \\(N\\) boxes numbered from 1 to \\(N\\), and \\(N\\) balls numbered from 1 to \\(N\\).\n\nYou have assigned Snuke the following procedure as homework:\n\n1.

This is because, once you determine the value for a vertex, the value for adjacent vertices is also determined in a chain. Thus, the problem can be solved by inspecting vertices one by one, and if the current vertex does not have a value assigned, set an arbitrary value (like 0) to it and determine the values for all the other connected vertices.

Let\u2019s assume that person 0 is always chosen. For each D = 1, 2, ..., it suffices to find the number of ways to choose people so that the cost is less than D. First, people D, ..., L - D cannot be chosen. Next, consider whom to choose among people 1, 2, ..., D - 1. They can be chosen freely without interfering with each other. Finally, consider whom to choose among people L - D + 1, ..., L - 1. The condition for choosing person i is that none of the people in [i - L + D, i - D] have been chosen so far. Here, this interval is basically included within [1, D - 1]. If 2 * D <= i, this interval extends beyond that range, but the exceeding part is included in [D, L - D], from which we already know we are not choosing anyone, so we don\u2019t need to consider it specially. Let W = L - 2 * D + 1. We can regard the operation of choosing people from L - D + 1, ..., L - 1 as the operation of choosing intervals of length W among people 1, ..., D - 1. Then, what we need to consider is selecting people and intervals from people 1, ..., D - 1 so that they do not overlap (it\u2019s acceptable for intervals themselves to overlap). We will call a person chosen in the people selection as a red person. Also, in the interval selection, we will call the starting person of the interval as a blue person. If we fix the number of times red and blue alternate, the total number of ways to choose can be expressed using binomial coefficients. Also, the number of alternations is at most N // W. Therefore, if we perform this calculation for all D, the total computational complexity is O(N + N // 2 + N // 3 + ...) = O(N log N), so it runs sufficiently fast.\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["agc068_a"]}, "abc342_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nScore: 350 points\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nYou are given a string \\( S \\) of length \\( N \\).

We will try to exploit the special form of the graph to optimize Kruskal\u2019s algorithm against it. We first sort the edges by their costs and appropriately reassign indices so that \\(C_1 \\leq C_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq C_Q\\). According to Kruskal\u2019s algorithm, one can determine the minimum spanning tree as follows:\n\nPrepare an \\((N + Q)\\)-vertex graph without an edge. For \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots ,Q\\) in order:\n\nFor each \\(j = L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i\\) in order, add an edge between vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) of cost \\(C_i\\) if and only if vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are not connected.\n\nWhile it is still difficult to handle the conditions, one can notice that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\(j\\) are always disconnected if \\(j =L_i\\), and that vertices \\((N + i)\\) and \\((j - 1)\\) are connected if and only if vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are, in order to realize that it is sufficient to perform connectivity check for vertices with adjacent indices: \\(j - 1\\) and \\(j\\). Also, the graph is disconnected if and only if there exists an integer \\(j\\) between \\(1\\) and \\((N-1)\\) (inclusive) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected. Naively implementing this still costs \\(\\Theta(NQ + Q\\log Q)\\), but now that the problem is simplified, there are various approaches.\n\n(1) Use a set (or similar data structure) Manage the set of \\(1 \\leq j < N\\) such that vertices \\((j - 1)\\) and \\(j\\) are disconnected in a data structure like the built-in set in Python, and remove those among \\(L_i, L_i + 1, \\ldots, R_i - 1\\) that is not in the set. Naively checking the existence for each element still leads to TLE, but one can use a method such as bisect.bisect_left that retrieves the position of the minimum element greater than or equal to \\(x\\), as removal of an element occurs at most \\((N - 1)\\) times and the complexity is bounded by \\(O((N + Q) \\log N)\\), which is fast enough.\n\n(2) Use a lazy segment tree One can also use a lazy segment tree that supports segment-sum retrieval and segment-filling with \\(0\\). The \\(j\\)-th element of the lazy segment tree should be \\(0\\) if vertices \\(j\\) and \\((j+1)\\) are connected, and \\(1\\) otherwise. Initialize such a segment tree of length \\((N-1)\\) all with \\(1\\); then the number of edges connecting vertex \\(N + i\\) and any of vertices \\(L_i + 1, L_i + 2, \\ldots, R_i\\) can be retrieved as the segment sum of \\([L_i, R_i)\\), and adding an edge is fulfilled by filling \\([L_i, R_i)\\) with \\(0\\).\n\n(3) Use bitwise operations While a naive scan-based algorithm on an array results in TLE (Time Limit Exceeded), one can make use of bitwise operations with almost the same idea. The answer can be found fast enough by managing connectivity for each \\((j, j+1)\\) using the built-in int type in Python and using a function that returns the next position of \\(1\\) in the same way as found in (1), the answer can be found fast enough.\n        [END TEXT]\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc364_f"]}, "abc343_c": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\nYou are given an integer sequence \\( A = (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N) \\) of length \\( N \\).

Once the scoring distribution is determined, arranging the penalties so that the smaller \\(R_i\\) values correspond to smaller penalties (within ties) will always minimize the squared error. Using something like `sorted`, the solution can be obtained in approximately \\(113N \\log N\\) computations.\n\nExample Scoring Distributions:\n- [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n- [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n... \n- [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nSteps to the solution:\n1. Consider scoring distributions based on problem-solving instances and ensure scores are non-decreasing.\n2. Extend the approach to contests with 5 problems, considering intersection points of hyperplanes in a 5-dimensional space.\n3. Prune duplicates and non-eligible scoring distributions, reducing the number of distributions to \\(113\\), allowing timely computations for input constraints.\n\nSample Implementation (Python):\n```python\n# Sample scoring distributions candidates\nCandidates = [ /* List of scoring distributions */ ]\n\ndef get_error(N, A, R, Score):\n    Sorted = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        sum_scores = sum(A[i][j] * Score[j] for j in range(5))\n        Sorted.append((sum_scores, -R[i]))\n    Sorted.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    error = 0\n    for i in range(N):\n        idx1 = -Sorted[i][1]\n        idx2 = i + 1\n        error += (idx1 - idx2) * (idx1 - idx2)\n    return error\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n        R = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        answer = float('inf')\n        for cand in Candidates:\n            result = get_error(N, A, R, cand)\n            answer = min(answer, result)\n        print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis concise edit provides essential problem-solving steps, example scoring distributions, and the complete Python implementation code without unnecessary information.\n        [END TEXT]\n \n", "problem_ids": ["arc177_e"]}, "abc343_e": {"text": "Similar Problem 1 \n\n Problem Statement:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nThe pattern of AtCoder's wallpaper can be represented on the xy-plane as follows:\n\n- The plane is divided by the following three types of lines:\n  - \\( x = n \\) (where \\( n \\) is an integer)\n  - \\( y = n \\) (where \\( n \\) is an even number)\n  - \\( x + y = n \\) (where \\( n \\) is an even number)\n\n- Each region is painted black or white.

Thus, one can solve this problem by counting for each of the eight \\(1 \\times 1\\) squares how many instances of them are contained in the given rectangle. In order to count the number of squares at each position, it may be difficult to handle boundaries. As an example, we take the following approach in the sample code below.\n\nCount squares along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes independently, and multiply it afterward. To count squares along the \\(x\\) axis, take a sufficiently large constant \\(P\\) that is a multiple of four (such as \\(1.1 \\times 10^9\\)), and compute \\((\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = C) - (\\text{The number of squares between }x = -P\\text{ and }x = A)\\).\n\nWe pick such \\(P\\) to avoid issues on rounding-down division toward \\(0\\). Do the same thing for the \\(y\\) axis.\n\nAlso, when debugging this type of problem, it is effective to generate cases by yourself. In this problem, if it is a boundary issue that matters, it is a good idea to try many cases for \\(0 \\leq A, B, C, D \\leq 8\\).\n\nSample code (Python):\n```python\nmass = [[2, 1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 2, 1, 0]]\n# mass[i][j] : area of rectangle [[j, j + 1], [i, i + 1]] x 2\n\ninf = 4000000000\n\n# input\na, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n\n# calculation\nans = 0\nfor fy in range(2):\n    for fx in range(4):\n        x1 = (a - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        x2 = (c - fx + 3 + inf) // 4\n        count_x = x2 - x1  # count along x axis\n        y1 = (b - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        y2 = (d - fy + 1 + inf) // 2\n        count_y = y2 - y1  # count along y axis\n        ans += count_x * count_y * mass[fy][fx]\n\n# output\nprint(ans)\n```\n \n", "problem_ids": ["abc354_d"]}}
